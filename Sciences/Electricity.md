# Electricity

## Charge

We use the completely arbitrary '+' and '-' symbols as a convention to represent that they are opposites, who attract & repel.

Charging something doesn't mean filling something that's empty.
It literally means adding or removing negative charges to make it + or -,
à la decreasing its entropy e.g. making it blue again when it's white (RGB #FFF, i.e. all the colours).

An electron has a much smaller mass than a proton, yet their charges are the same! And opposites:

  e = Charge of Proton = - Charge of Electron
  C = 6,24 x 10^18 e
  
Coulomb's Law aka Electrostatic Force

  Fe = Ke |q1 x q2| / r²
  Ke = 9 x 10^9 Nm² / C²

Conservation of Charge = No matter the number and nature of particles in a closed system, their total charge stays the same.

## Field

How does a particle know it there's another one to which it must be attracted if they don't touch at all?
Faraday tells that each particle actually produces a vectorized field around it at all times, whose intensity is inversely relative to the distance to the particle.

A Field is not an electric Force (that only applies between several particles).
It is produced by one Particle, and will exert a Force on every other Charge than its producer (like a spider web).

A Field simplifies the system, because it is local, so we can ignore remote influences.
