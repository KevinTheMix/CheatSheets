# [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

Firebase is a development platform developed by Google for creating and scaling mobile/web applications.

It is essentially a BaaS, Backend as a Service, cloud platform offering a large array of Backend features like Data storing, Authentication, Analytics, A/B testing, and with an ecosystem of additional extensions for payments, translating, emails, ElasticSearch/TypeSense, etc.

It is also very cheap for starting applications until they grow an active userbase, and its SDK is well-documented.
