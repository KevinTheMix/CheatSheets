## Arithmetic

### Fractions

Dividing a by b is to count the number of b steps in a.
Dividing by a fraction = mutliplying by inverse fraction.
E.g.: 10 % 1/2 = number of steps of size 1/2 in 10 (= 20)

### Negative Numbers

Absolute values = distance from zero, either way.
Oppositing both sides of an inequality reverses the inequality.
Oppositing a number = sending it to the other side of zero.

## Algebra

* Expression = some stuff
  * 2ax+b
* Addition/Sum = a + b
* Subtraction/Difference = a - b
* Product = a . b
* Factor = part of a product (variable or constant)
* Term = part of an addition/subtraction
* Coefficient = multiplier of a variable.
  * Ratio between variables = coeff a / coeff b
* Equ-ations = Eg-alités
* Inequ-ations = Inég-alités
* Independant Variable = x (fluctuates/varies naturally)
* Dependant Variable = y (depends on x), alone on its side of an equation

## Functions

* Point-Slope intercept
  * y = ax + b
  * Advantage = y-intercept, slope
* Standard form
  * ax + by = c
  * Advantage = x & y intercepts
* ...
  * y2-y1/x2-x1
  * Advantages = built from points

## Shapes

### Quadrilateral

* Trapezoid = 2 sides //
* Parallelogram = 4 sides //
* Rectangle = 4-// and 90° angles
* Rhombuse = 4-// and same length
* Square = Rectangle + Rhombus

#### Perimeter & Area

* Perimeter = sum of sides, additive in nature.
  * stays the same if subtract one side and add the other by the same quantity.
  * Joined same rectangles => 2 x (perimeter of one - joined side)
  * Pi = Radius-to-Perimeter ratio of a circle

* Area = product of sides, multiplicative in nature.
  * Trapezoid = (Bottom + Top) * Height / 2
  * Parallelogram = Base * Height
  * Triangle = Base * Height / 2
  * stays the same if divide one side and multiply the other by the same quantity.

* Area vs Perimeter
  * [Area of Square is larger than rectangle](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1082524)
  * Perimeter of square is smaller than rectangle if same area:
  
With b & c the difference from a such as

    a² = (a+b).(a-c)
  
then

    a-c < a < a+b

E.g. a=4 and if we take a-c=3.9, then c=0.1, then (a+b) = a²/(a-c) and (a+b) = (4*4/3.9) = 4.102.., so b=0.102..

    a² = (a+b).(a-c) = a² + ab - ac - bc
    0 = ab - ac - bc
    ab = ac - bc
    b = c + bc/a
    b > c (in our example, 0.102 > 0.1)
    b - c > 0
    b - c + 2a > 2a
    (a+b) + (a-c) > 2a
    perimeter rectangle is larger than perimeter square

### Triangles

* Base = arbitrary side chosen as base
* Height = line joining the base, perpendicular to it, and the opposite point.
  * The height of a rectangle triangle is the adjacent side of its 90° angle.
* Area = Base * Height / 2

### 3D

* Vertices = points
* Edges = lines
* Faces = areas
* Triangular Prism = Toblerone
* Square Pyramid = Toblerone piece

## Statistics

* Mean = Average = Total / Count
* Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) = Mean of deltas from the Mean
* Quartiles
  * Q2 = Median = middle value(s)
    * Odd = 1 value
    * Even = Mean of 2 values
    * The middle line in a Box Plot
  * Q1 is the Median of the subset of the values left from the Median.
  * Q3 is the Median of the subset of the values right from the Median.
* Interquartile Range (IQR) = Difference between Q1 & Q3.
  * In case of an even starting set, the values part of the Median are each part of their respective subsets.
  * Gives a feel of 50% of values.
* Mode = Most common (highest frequency)
* Peak = Max value
* Gap = No values
* Outlier = Solo value
* Cluster = Grouped values
* Skewed on one side = fewer values on that side
* Histogram
  * Easy to find peaks, inequalities, outliers, gaps
* Box Plot = Min 25% Q1 25% Median 25% Q3 25% Max
  * Middle box contains 50% of all values
  * Easy to find Median, percentage partitions
