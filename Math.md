## Perimeter & Area

* Perimeter = sum of sides, additive in nature.
  * stays the same if subtract one side and add the other by the same quantity.
  * Joined rectangles => 3 x perimeter of one minus 2 x joined side
  * Pi = Radius-to-Perimeter ratio of a circle

* Area = product of sides, multiplicative in nature.
  * stays the same if divide one side and multiply the other by the same quantity.

* Area vs Perimeter
  * [Area of Square is larger than rectangle](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1082524)
  * Perimeter of square is smaller than rectangle if same area:
  
With b & c the difference from a such as

    a² = (a+b).(a-c)
  
then

    a-c < a < a+b

E.g. a=4 and if we take a-c=3.9, then c=0.1, then (a+b) = a²/(a-c) and (a+b) = (4*4/3.9) = 4.102.., so b=0.102..

    a² = (a+b).(a-c) = a² + ab - ac - bc
    0 = ab - ac - bc
    ab = ac - bc
    b = c + bc/a
    b > c (in our example, 0.102 > 0.1)
    b - c > 0
    b - c + 2a > 2a
    (a+b) + (a-c) > 2a
    perimeter rectangle is larger than perimeter square
