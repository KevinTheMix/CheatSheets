# Math

## Perimeter

Pi = rapport périmètre-rayon d'un cercle
Perimeter = Sum of sides.
Joined rectangles: 3 x perimeter of one minus 2 x joined side

## Equations

Equ-ations = Eg-alités
Inequ-ations = Inég-alités
Expressions = 2ax+b

## Functions

Point-Slope intercept

  y = ax + b

Advantage = y-intercept, slope

Standard form

  ax + by = c

Advantage = x & y intercepts

...

  yp2-yp1/xp2-xp1

Advantages = built from points
