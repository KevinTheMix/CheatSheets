## Glossary

* **Agile** = adaptable, reactive framework promoting teamwork, aimed to combat failed waterfall projects lacking in communication, allegedly beats the alternative
* **Back-Office** = support business infrastructure (eg accounting, IT, HR, compliance)
* **Definition of Done** = when a US is considered complete
* **Key Performance Indicator** (KPI) = concrete/measurable/palpable metric self-chosen by business to measure whether it's meeting its goals
* **Front-Office** = customer-facing operations & generate revenue (eg sales, marketing, customer service/support, business development)
* **Product Owner** = responsible for USs
* **Scrum** = aswers the question "how do we self-organize as a _development_ team?", seems easy on the surface, actually digs deep (social/company/national culture)
* **Scrum Master** = team helper/support (eg taskboard redactor), shield against outside forces, process > progress
* **Sprint Review** = prepared & rehearsed demo presentation for the layman (no in-depth figures, syntesize) in collaboration with PO
  * Presentation: establish/remind project context then sprint, each team member presents (or at least gets credited/mentioned)
* **Sprint Retro** = team feedback & action plan
* **Sprint Planning** = synchronize with PO to create/validate/prioritize remaining USs
* **Team** = fundational component of Scrum, empowered with design/planning decision capabilities (ideally), its collective mind is the greatest asset
  * All processes can be refined by the team as necessary to suit the team/the work.
  * Any "Task" can be picked up by any one team member (+ or -).

* **Jira** = collaborative agile project management & issue/bug tracking software product
  * **JQL** (Jira Query Language) = dedicated search language to create complete queries for issue tracking, advanced filtering, reporting, helping navigate large datasets

### Daily Stand Up Meeting (DSTUM)

Daily timeboxed & equally timeshared individual status update.

* Ping Pong for next
* Structure agreed by whole Team
* On rentre pas trop dans le détail
* Commencer call à l'heure pile (=> 15 mins)
* Write down any feedback coming up for later Retro
* What I did / What will I do until next DST (tomorrow)
* Éclaircir qui aide qui (sans rentrer dans les détails)
* Quels problèmes rencontrés / Point bloquant (impediment)
* Ce que j'ai fait depuis hier / fait maintenant / ferai ensuite
* Only for communication within the team, by the Team, for the Team
* **Not** for management, though they can participate as _silent_ observers
* Any impediments? Who will connect/talk together after (don't discuss now)
* Si discussion démarre sur la fin, officialiser la fin du DSTUM, continuer la discussion
