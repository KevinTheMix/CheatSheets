## Glossary

* **Cyber Threat Intelligence** (CBI) = structured collection, analysis, and dissemination of data regarding potential/existing cyber threats
* **Digital Forensics and Incident Response** (DFIR) = two discrete security disciplines
  * **Digital Forsensics** = postmortem investigate & gather evidence and establish facts (from FS, memory, system & network logs)
  * **Incident Response** = detection/mitigation of potential or in progress cyberattacks (prepare, detect/analyze, contain/eradicate/recover, do better)
* **Firewall**
  * **Application Firewall** = controls I/O or system calls of an application/service, monitors & blocks communications based on configured policy (either Network-based for TCP/IP on Host-based for system calls)
  * **Web Application Firewall** (WAF) = specific application firewall to filter/monitor/block HTTP traffic, mitigating known (eg SQLi, XSS, FI) and zero-day vulnerabilities
* **InfoSec** (Information Security) = protecting information by mitigating risks
* **Intrusion Prevention System** (IPS) = monitors network traffic for potential threats & automatically blocks them by alerting security team, terminating dangerous connections, removing malicious content
* **OPSEC** (Operation Security) = military analysis of whether critical information is accessible to the enemy (trackability prevention)
  * Also refers to obfuscating/hiding techniques by hackers to evade security & getting found
* **OWASP** (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) = online community producing free articles/methodologies/tools on IoT, software & web security
* **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management) = combines SIM & SEM to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications & network hardware
  * **SIM** (Security Information Management) = long-term storage & analysis/reporting of log data
  * **SEM** (Security Event Management) = real-time monitoring & correlation of events/notifications/console views
* **SOC** (Security Operations Center) = always-on hub of dedicated team/processes/tools that monitori, detect, analyze, respond to incidents/threats across an organization

## Learn

* **Capture The Flag** (CTF) = exercise to find flags (ie text strings) secretly hidden in purposefully vulnerable programs/websites, for educational/competitive purposes
* **CCNA** (Cisco Certified Network Associate) = network certification
* **CompTIA** (Computing Technology Industry Association) = US trade association issuing vendor-neutral (eg not Cisco-specific) professional IT certifications
  * Eg _A+_ (Help Desk Support Specialist), _Network+_, _PenTest+_, _Security+_, _Security Pro_, _Cybersecurity Analyst+_ (CySA+)
* **Hack The Box** (HTB) = online cybersecurity courses & certifications
  * **CPTS** (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) = Hack The Box certification
* **Hack This Site**
* **OSCP** (Offensive Security Certified Professional, by _Offensive Security_ aka _Offsec_) = ethical hacking certification (gold standard for cybersecurity certifications)
* **OverTheWire** = bandit, natas, â€¦
* **picoCTF** (_Carnegie Mellong University_) = CTFs courses & competitions
* **TryHackMe** = CTFs (more beginner friendly than HTB)

## Tools

* [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com) = look up blacklisted IP addresses
* [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) = scan files using multiple antivirus engines
