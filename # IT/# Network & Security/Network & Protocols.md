## Glossary

* **Directory Service** = maps network resources names to their respective network (eg IP) addresses (eg DNS)
* **DMZ** (De-Militarized Zone) = network area that's neither internal or public, where public-facing (email/web) servers get placed
  * Traffic with a DMZ is mostly one-way towards it, ie it has very limited connectivity towards the internal network (as much as the firewall allows basically)
  * Clients connect _directly_ (through the firewall) to different servers **within the DMZ**; that is unlike a reverse proxy that hides all the internal servers behind it
* **gRPC** = Google cross-platform open source bi-directional real-time RPC framework using HTTP/2 for transport & **Protobuf** to encode data, usually connecting microservices or mobile clients to backends
  * **Interceptors** = both at client & server endpoints enable inspection & modification (Ã  la middleware, ie logging,metrics, authentication, retries, rate limiting)
  * Ideal for communication between internal tightly-coupled (micro)services sharing a strict common IDL contract (faster than HTTP1.1+REST overhead)
  * Not ideal for loosely-coupled public/external/universal facing services (cannot use cURL, Postman, IIS)
* **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
* **HTTP/2** = major revision of HTTP (developed by Google), derived from (obsolete) SPDY communication protocol, supported by nearly 100% of browsers
* **HTTPd** (HTTP daemon) = any software running as background process and playing server in a client-server model, using HTTP(S) protocol (eg Apache HTTP Server)
* **HTTPS** (HTTP Secure) = TLS layer between HTTP & TCP, attested via a digitally signed server certificate, initiated via public crypto key handshake
* **IDL** (Interface Description Language) = WSDL-like contract/model description for gRPC
* **IEEE 802** = family of standards for LAN (local), PAN (personal) & MAN (metropolitan)
  * **IEEE 802.03** = Ethernet cable type
  * **IEEE 802.11** = WLAN (Wi-Fi)
  * **IEEE 802.16** = WirelessMAN aka WiMAX
* **Jitter** = time gap consistency between data packets, becomes chaotic in case of congestion (eg choppy voice/video call)
* **LDAP(S)** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (Secure)) = open vendor-neutral application protocol (OSI model layer 7) for accessing/maintaining distributed directory (ie centralized authentication) service over IP network
* **Marshalling** = ensuring data gets from point A to point B (broader than serialization)
* **NTP** (Network Time Protocol) = time provider, usually from a centralized server (NTP Server accessed from NTP Clients)
* **Packet Switching** = grouping data into short messages in fixed format transmitted over a network (a channel is occupied during transmission of a packet only, and made available afterwards)
* **PAN** (Personal Area Network) = own private network (bluetooth, IR, NFC eg automotile, wireless headset, connected watch)
* **PAT** (Port Address Translation, or NAT Overload) = router mechanism enabling local network device to send/receive corresponding traffic (initiated locally) from internet, from a single shared public IP
* **Port** = communication endpoint, can be non-ephemeral/permanent (_0 to 1023_) or ephemeral (_1024 to 65535_)
* **Port Forwarding** (or **Port Mapping**) = redirects traffic from one port to another (used in PAT or reverse SSH tunneling)
  * **Remote Port Forwarding** = redirecting network traffic from one local device's port to a remote device's port
  * **Static Port Forwarding** = manual router NAT rule configuration enabling unsolicited inbound connections to a specific local device's IP & port, making it accessible from internet
* **Protocol Buffers** (aka _Protobuf_) = FOSS Google cross-platform (efficient binary) data format used to serialize strongly-typed/structured data (described via IDL)
* **Proxy (Server)** = application-layer intermediary in a client-server network, can be forward (at client) or reverse (at server)
* **RDP** (Remote Desktop Protocol)
* **Reverse Proxy** = accepts incoming client connections on behalf of server, hiding & representing it to outside world, for load balancing, security (eg DMZ), caching, logging, monitoring user activty
* **Reverse SSH Tunneling** = have a (hard to reach/well-protected) remote computer open a connection back to local/public machine
  * Remote starts by `ssh -R {local_port}:localhost:22 {user}@{local_server}` = remote's SSH client calls local's SSHD (configured to accept this) and binds local's port to the tunnel linked to remote's SSHD port 22
  * Local can now `ssh -p {local_port} {user}@localhost` = local's SSH client connects _locally_ to alternate port, with TCP traffic tunneled to remote via remote port forwarding
* **RPC** (Remote Procedure Call) = client-server stubs serialize local method call (ie strongly-typed) to remote handler and back (eg over HTTP/2 for gRPC)
* **SFTP** = file transfer over ssh
* **SSH** (Secure Shell) = application-layer client-server crypto protocol for network services over unsecured network (first remote login, then either CLI or GUI via X11 Forwarding-compatible apps)
  1. establish plain TCP channel (over port 22 by convention, via three-way ACK/SYN-ACK/ACK handshake)
  2. agree on SSH protocol version & key exchange algorithms (aka KEX, eg _curve25519_/_ECDH_/_DH_)
  3. server immediately sends public key (ie half of asymmetric key pair generated by algorithm, eg _ECDSA_/_Ed25519_/_RSA_) inside its key exchange reply
  4. client compares server public key against version it has cached in a _~/.ssh/known\_hosts_ file (if public key for same host has changed, a clear warning is issued)
  5. if host is yet unknown, TOFU model (Trust-on-First-Use) applies: a shorter/human-friendly (SHA-256, previously MD5) hashed fingerprint of server public key is calculated & presented to user to confirm they have verified its authenticity, potentially comparing it against out-of-band information
  6. in case of a valid new connection, client saves (based64-encoded) server public key along with (salted & HMAC-hashed because also treated as sensitive) hostname in _~/.ssh/known\_hosts_
  7. key exchange occurs using one of KEX algorithms established earlier, and mutiple symmetric keys (eg _AES_) are derived (one per direction & for MAC)
  8. further communication now symmetrically encrypted & MAC-signed
  9. server finally authenticates client (now that server validity was assured and a secure communication channel was established between parties) via either public key (ie a challenge) or password (less secure)
  * Public key is the preferred choice, as it eliminates passing password over channel (even hashed, can be brute-forced, replayed), and human factor (must be remembered, rotated)
* **SMB** (Server Message Block) aka **CIFS** (Common Internet File System) = Windows communication protocol used to share eg files, printers, serial ports (with Kerberos/NTLM authentication)
* **SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer) = deprecated encryption protocol replaced with **TLS**
* **SSL/TLS Handshake** = client initiates an asymmetric connexion, then sends a (faster & more efficient for large amounts of data) symmetric key encrypted using server public key found in its certificate
  * Client initiates connection to the server on port 443 (the default port for HTTPS)
  * Server responds by presenting its SSL/TLS certificate file content (over TLS itself, with TCP underneath)
  * Client verifies certificate (CA signature, domain name) & initiate a (symmetric) session key exchange (Diffie-Hellmann or some variation)
  * Server must sign that key exchange using its certificate private key (only that key is able to complete that challenge)
  * An attacker possessing only the public certificate cannot forge a signature, nor decrypt handshake messages
  * The client and server have now established a secure connection, and use exchanged key to encrypt future communication
* **Single Sign-On** (SSO) = login once and use multiple systems/applications, improving user experience (eg OAuth 2.0 google/facebook, or entreprise-wide SAML-based SSO eg Azure AD or Okta)
* **SOCKS** = application-layer lightweight general-purpose proxy protocol, facilitates client-server communication through a firewall
  * SOCKS-compatible programs (such as Firefox) usually exhibit some sort of "network settings" where a SOCKS proxy can be entered through which all traffic is directed
  * Convenient with `ssh -d`, but any program that can accept a TCP connection and speak the few-byte SOCKS handshake can be a SOCKS server

* _OpenSSL_ = implements TLS/SSL & other crypto functions (AES, RSA, SHA), with certificate handling (X.509), key generation/signing/verification
* _OpenVPN_ = FOSS client/server VPN using OpenSSL encryption library

  * **Unicast** = one-to-one transmission (specific node)
* **APIPA** (Automatic Private IP Addressing) = scheme to let a device configure its own **link-local IP** in absence of any DHCP Server
  * **Link-Local Address** = self-assigned random IP (in range _169.254.1.0 - 169.254.254.255_ with 2x256 reserved addresses), cannot be used to route outside local subnet (so, no internet connectivity)
  * Sends a broadcast **ARP** request to whole subnet to confirm randomly chosen address does not conflict with an existing IP of another device
* **Autonomous System** (AS) = collection of IP networks (ie routing prefixes) operated under one (or more) organization (eg ISPs, GAFAMs, universities, governments, CDNs), presenting a unified routing policy to the internet
* **Autonomous System Number** (ASN)
* **Border Gateway Protocol** (BGP) = exterior gateway global routing/reachability tables
* **CIDR** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) = method for allocating IP addresses for IP routing, introduced by IETF in 1993 to replace classful networks architecture
  * Classless IP addresses are not interpreted as part of one of the original (A/B/C/D/E) classful networks, allowing finer grain division and slowing down exhaustion of IPv4 while IPv6 deploys
* **CIDR Block**
* **CIDR Notation** = compact representation of an IP address & associated network mask (eg `198.51.100.14/24` indicating a 24 leading 1-bits network prefix `198.51.100.0` & subnet mask `255.255.255.0`)
* **Classful Network** = obsolete network addressing architecture (by IANA) dividing IP addressing space into a small number of discrete classes attributed to organizations according to their sizes
  * Masks are kept simple and with a full-octet boundary (ie 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0 and 255.255.255.0, ie not in between bits like /7)
  * Class **A** = _0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255_ (ie first bit is 0, mask 255.0.0.0 or /8)
    * Actually less than that:
      * _0.0.0.0_ (default unspecified address) to _0.255.255.255_ are reserved (named "this network" block)
      * _10.0.0.0/8_ = private addresses (24-bit block, see below)
      * _127.0.0.0/8_ = loopback adresses that cannot be assigned to a network (16M unusable addresses)
  * Class **B** = _128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255_ (mask 255.255.0.0 or /16)
  * Class **C** = _192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255_ (mask 255.255.255.0 or /24)
  * Class **D** (multi cast) & Class E (reserved) = _224.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255_ (broadcast)
  * Some ranges within those classes are permanentely carved out of public usage because they are reserved for **private networks**
  * Networks established with this scheme were either too small or way too large for actual organization needs, leading to exhaustion of IPv4 addresses
* **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) = IP network management protocol for automatically assigning IP addresses & other communication parameters to devices, using a client-server architecture
  * IP-less computers looking to connect start by sending a UDP DHCP probe to the entire network (ie _255.255.255.255:67_), to which any DHCP servers respond with an IP offer

* **Local Internet Registry** (LIR) = organization (usually an ISP/entreprise/academic institution) that was allocated an IP Address Block by a RIR to assign to its own customers
* **Loopback** = routes back to source without intentional modification, primarily to test communication infrastructure (eg _127.0.0.1_ or _http://[::1]_)
* **MTU** (Maximum Transmission Unit) = largest protocol data unit (PDU) that can be communicated in a single network layer transaction
* **Network Prefix** (or Network Number or Routing Prefix) = network portion of an IP address
* **Private Network** = subnet with addresses in private IP ranges, for LANs in residential/office/enterprise environments
  * IETF has directed IANA to reserve following IPv4 address ranges for private networks(RFC 1918):
  * 24-bit block = _10.0.0.0/8_ (ie _10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255_)
  * 20-bit block = _172.16.0.0/12_ (ie _172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255_)
  * 16-bit block = _192.168.0.0/16_ (ie _192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255_)
* **Quad-Dotted Notation** = 4 number specific case of Dot-decimal notation (decimal numbers separated by _._ dots)
* **Regional Internet Registry** (RIR) = organization managing allocation & registration of (public) internet number resources within a world region
* **Routing Prefix** (aka **Network Number**) = network part of an IP address
* **Subnet** = mathematical/logical prefix-length-based subdivision of an IP network, defining two parts to IP addresses (a network prefix & host identifier)
  * Number of attributable host addresses in a (sub)network = 2^number of bits in host portion (minus two: (sub)network & broadcasting addresses, ie all host bits to _0_ & _1_ respectively)
  * Subnetting is not just for private networks, RIR/LIR/ISPs all need to subnet their allocated address block
