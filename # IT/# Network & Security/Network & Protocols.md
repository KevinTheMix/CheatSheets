# Network & Protocols

## Quick Tips

* [DNSstuff tools](https://www.dnsstuff.com/freetools)
* Florent = HTTP requests handled by local _Nginx_ serving Vue app through bi-directional VPN tunnel via _WireGuard_ (adding OS-level virtual network I/Os) between local (dynamic IP) machine and public remote (fixed IP) _DigitalOcean Droplet_ VM

## Glossary

* **Active Directory** (AD) = directory service for Windows domain networks using a number of standardized protocols to provide a variety of network services (eg DNS-based naming)
* **Directory Service** = maps network resources names to their respective network (eg IP) addresses (eg DNS)
* **DMZ** (De-Militarized Zone) = network area that's neither internal or public, where public-facing (email/web) servers get placed
  * Traffic with a DMZ is mostly one-way towards it, ie it has very limited connectivity towards the internal network (as much as the firewall allows basically)
  * Clients connect _directly_ (through the firewall) to different servers **within the DMZ**; that is unlike a reverse proxy that hides all the internal servers behind it
* **gRPC** = cross-platform open source RPC framework (by Google) using HTTP/2 for transport & **Protobuf** to encode data, usually connecting microservices or mobile clients to backends
  * Faster than HTTP, cannot be used with IIS
* **HTTP/2** = major revision of HTTP (developed by Google), derived from (obsolete) SPDY communication protocol, supported by nearly 100% of browsers
* **HTTPS** = TLS layer between HTTP & TCP, attested via a digitally signed server certificate, initiated via public crypto key handshake
* **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol) = Network layer supporting IP suite protocol, used by routers (and some by users eg `ping`, `traceroute`) to send error messages and OK/NOK statuses
* **IPSec** (Internet Protocol Security) = network-layer protocol suite that secures IP packets by authenticating/encrypting each of them in a session
  * Uses IKE (Internet Key Exchange) to negotiate keys & settings
* **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol** (LDAP) = open neutral application protocol (OSI model layer 7) for accessing/maintaining distributed directory service over IP network
* **Protocol Buffers** (aka _Protobuf_) = FOSS cross-platform data format (by Google) used to serialize structured data, described via a WSDL-like Interface Description Language (IDL)
* **Proxy (Server)** = intermediary in a client-server network, can be forward (at client) or reverse (at server)
* **PuTTY** = FOSS (ssh, telnet, etc) terminal client for (OS/hardware) administration over networks, (originally) for Windows
* **Reverse Proxy** = accepts incoming client connections on behalf of server, hiding & representing it to outside world, for security (eg DMZ), caching, logging, monitoring user activty
* **Reverse SSH Tunneling** = have a (usually well-protected) remote computer open a connection back to local machine (with SSH started from local machine)
* **SSH** (Secure Shell) = client-server crypto protocol for network services over unsecured network (ie remote login, then CLI or GUI via X11 Forwarding-compatible apps, file transfer via **SFTP**)
  * Exchange shared secret (session key) over an insecure channel using ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)
  * Once that session key is shared, all traffic is encrypted using a faster symmetric cipher (eg AES)
  * Authentication is then established via either public key (eg ed25519) or password (less secure)
* **SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer) = deprecated encryption protocol replaced with **TLS**
* **Single Sign-On** (SSO) = login once and use multiple systems/applications, improving user experience (eg OAuth 2.0 google/facebook, or entreprise-wide SAML-based SSO eg Azure AD or Okta)
* **SOCKS** = application-layer lightweight general-purpose proxy protocol, facilitates client-server communication through a firewall
  * Convenient with `ssh -d`, but any program that can accept a TCP connection and speak the few-byte SOCKS handshake can be a SOCKS server
* **Telnet** = older (abandoned in favor of **SSH**) bi-directional client-server application protocol to access virtual terminals of remote system on LAN/Internet
* **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) = cryptographic protocol to provide communications security over a network
* **TLS Handshake** = client initiates an asymmetric connexion, then sends a (faster & more efficient for large amounts of data) symmetric key encrypted using server public key found in its certificate
* **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) = full network access via encrypted link (through VPN server), with optional firewall/NAT
* **VPS** (Virtual Private Server) = VM simulating a dedicated physical server environment (but actually shared with other users)
* **X.500** = series of networking standards covering electronic directory services

* _FileZilla Server_ = FTP Server
* _LeechFTP_ = multi-threaded FTP client
* _OpenSSH_ = cross-platform (BSD licence) suite of SSH-based secure channel utilities (eg **sshd** a SSH server daemon) over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture
* _OpenSSL_ = implements TLS/SSL & other crypto functions (AES, RSA, SHA), with certificate handling (X.509), key generation/signing/verification
* _OpenVPN_ = FOSS client/server VPN using OpenSSL encryption library
* _Putty_ = FOSS SSH/SCP & Telnet/rlogin client (1999)
