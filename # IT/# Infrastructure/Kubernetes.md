# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source production-grade orchestrating platform for placing & executing (not necessarily Docker) containers, enabling availability/flexility/scalability.

## Quick Tips

## Glossary

* **Cluster** = group of machines (nodes) acting together (ie scaling)
* **Orchestrator** = manages lifecycle & locations of various containers, with error control & restart capabilities (eg Azure Fabric Service, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesosphere)
