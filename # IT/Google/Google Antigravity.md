## Glossary

* **Agent Manager** = bird's eye view into agents, knowledge, playground, workspaces
* **Inbox** = track all conversations in one place (even closed chats so eg pending treatments awaiting approval can be resumed)
* **Knowledge Item** (KI) = persistent memory system to automatically capture & organize important insights/patterns/solutions from coding sessions
* **Playground** = independent sandbox workspace
* **Rules** = always-on manually defined constraints for agent to follow (as a Markdown file)
  * _~/.gemini/GEMINI.md_ = global rule applied across all workspaces
  * _./agent/rules_ = workspace rules
* **Workflow** = explicitly triggerable (via `/workflow-name`) prompt (series of steps, saved as a Markdown file) to guide an agent through a repetitive set of tasks (eg deploying a service, responding to PR comments)
