# Flutter

Highly performant (close to native) open-source UI **SDK** by Google for cross mobile (Android/iOS) & desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux) & later Web applications from a single (Dart) codebase.

Flutter was started as an experiment by members of the Chrome team for a new kind of layout/rendering engine.

Features:

* Everything is Dart (no specialized layout HTML/XML language)
* Everything is a widget (including pure layout components eg **Center**, **Padding**), all (visual element) leaves are **RenderObject**
  * Widgets are UI building blocks as app blueprint/recipe, based on (Google) Material & (Apple) Cupertino design
* Flutter is faster than React Native, closer to native performance (see graph Fireship's R vs F)
* Native pixel painting (à la Unity/Unreal) via Skia/Impeller painting libraries
* Advanced 2D/3D morph/transform animations à la PowerPoint transitions (see eg **Transform** widget)
* Access to native features (location, maps, camera), especially wrapped through rich 3rd-party growing plugins ecosystem
* State-based [declarative style](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/declarative) with reactive views (ie `UI = f(State)`)
  * UI isn't manually managed (à la WinForm) or even via individual bound mutable properties/viewmodel (à la WPF), only state is managed to rebuild UI parts
  * UI gets updated Flutter granularly/modularly replacing immutable widget(s) in hierarchy with other immutable widgets
    * Components don't get updated, instead old ones get dropped & replaced very quickly with fresh ones
  * Flutter compares old & new widget trees, and updates UI accordingly (if necessary)
  * State is separated from widgets, so as they get replaced, **state persists**

## Quick Tips

* [Medium blogs](https://blog.flutter.dev)
* [Flutter: Cookbook](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
* [@Wm Leler](https://leler.com/wm/bio.html#flutter) = Flutter-promoting articles (eg _what's revolutionary?_, _why Dart?_ UX study with eight developers, _company pitch_)
  * Most of the time, Flutter can do layout in a single pass (or even none, through cacheing), aka linear time, so it can even be used for scrolling & any animations
* [Matthew Smith - Why we chose Flutter and how it's changed our company](https://medium.com/@matthew.smith_66715/why-we-chose-flutter-and-how-its-changed-our-company-for-the-better-271ddd25da60)
* _const_ in front of constructors is very important, making rendering more efficient by skipping most of rebuild
* It's possible to create & assign widgets to variables, then we can access their properties (eg height) down the tree, or add them conditionally in several places
* Break down long widgets into modular widgets rather than helper methods (see Decoding Flutter video on that topic)
* Use `compute()` (similar to Dart `Isolate.run()`) to run a given callback in background, for operations that take longer than a few milliseconds
* `build()` should remain 'pure' ie without side-effects (see <https://stackoverflow.com/a/52249579/3559724>)
* [Material Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder) = generate dynamic color schemes (pick primary, secondary, etc)
* Refactor small widget subtrees subject to frequent change out of large `build()` methods to leverage **more granular & efficient rebuilds**
* Builders are methods that can map data to return widgets dynamically, also enable describing UI declaratively (as `build()` does)

## Glossary

* [Architecture](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/architectural-overview#anatomy-of-an-app)
  * **Dart App** = user custom app written entirely in Dart language
  * **Framework** = Flutter classes (high-level API in Dart)
  * **Engine** = platform-agnostic low-level API in C/C++, including rendering engine (eg Skia), Dart Runtime (including Dart VM that runs user Dart & framework Flutter code), platform channels, Embedder API
  * **Embedder** = native application hosting all Flutter content, interfaces host OS & Flutter, is app main entrypoint (as an Android Activity or iOS UIViewController), manages event loop & lifecycle
  * **Runner** = native-level customizable code (originally generated via `flutter create`)
  * [Inside Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter) = optimized & single pass layouting, onboarding strategies
* [BLoC](https://www.flutterclutter.dev/flutter/basics/what-is-the-bloc-pattern/2021/2084) = state management design pattern using Streams of events (in) & states (out)
* `build(BuildContext context)` = is itself a sort of _builder_ (ie indirect callback)
* [Build Modes](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/build-modes) = Debug (development, Hot Reload), Profile (performances analysis), Release (release app)
* **BuildContext** = context for current widget, holds a reference to its corresponding Element, handle for widget location in its tree
* [CanvasKit](https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit) = lightweight version of Skia compiled to WebAssembly optimized for web browser (paint to HTML canvas/SVG) via WebGL
* [Casual Games Toolkit](https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/games-toolkit) = mobile games development resources
* **Configuration** = refers to a widget's input parameters/properties provided by its parent, or to a Widget in relation to its corresponding Element
* **Element** (implements **BuildContext**) = instantiation of a Widget at a particular location in the _Element Tree_ (that Widget is considered that Element's _configuration_)
  * An elements is very simple, holding just a reference to associated widget (& its original type), its children elements, and potential State
  * Elements are mutable and modified in place to reflect changes in Widgets tree, hence Elements tree is seldom rebuilt & more stable, and acts as a buffer/**cache** between configuration & rendering
  * Element Tree acts as an app skeleton, and is built and handled all automatically by Flutter (based on the Widget Tree), using it to pilot widgets lifecycle, and update/redraw UI
  * (You can think of Elements as association tables, because they hold practically no data and mostly point to other stuff (Widget & State))
  * **StatefulElement** = an **Element** that uses a **StatefulWidget** as its configuration
  * **StatelessElement** = an **Element** that uses a **StatelessWidget** as its configuration
  * **ComponentElement** = container/host for other elements
* [Flutter Create](http://flutter.dev/create) = a one-time coding competition in 2019
* **FVM** (Flutter Version Management) = small CLI tool to manage several Flutter SDK relseases side-by-side
* [Impeller](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Impeller) = latest rendering enging replacing Skia (already on iOS since Flutter 3.10), eliminating costly runtime shader compiling
* [Internationalization](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization)
* **Keys** — see [@Emily Fortuna - Keys! What are they good for?](https://medium.com/flutter/keys-what-are-they-good-for-13cb51742e7d)
  * A way to keep track of States (ie for Stateful Widgets only), useful when adding/reordering widgets on the screen
  * **LocalKey** = match elements in their local tree (ie among its siblings), so put them at top of (sub)tree to preserve
    * **UniqueKey** = à la GUID
    * **ObjectKey** = bases off multiple values (eg address) which aggregated are unique
    * **ValueKey** = bases off a single value (eg TODO item task's text) which is unique amongst its siblings
      * **PageStorageKey** = persists a widget state (including user scroll location) so it can be resumed upon recreation
  * **GlobalKey** = unique across entire app, access/preverves a widget state (ie `GlobalKey<{state}>` eg **AnimatedListState** or **NavigatorState**) from anywhere in tree (via `kokoKey.currentState`)
    * **GlobalObjectKey**
    * **LabeledGlobalKey**
* **Packages**/**Modules** = Dart code **only**; can use plugins (and still qualify as a package); they're published to <https://pub.dev>
* **Platform Channel** = bi-directional communication between Flutter custom code and native platform, with serialization (thus slowser than FFIs) via _codecs_
  * **MethodChannel** = invoke a method on native platform and get back some value
  * **EventChannel** = stream data continuously/unidirectionally from native platform to Flutter
  * **BasicMessageChannel** = send/receive asynchronous messages in both directions
* **Property** = actual value held in a widget eg the _text_ property of a **RichText** widget
* **RenderBox** (extends **RenderObject**) = 2D Cartesian coordinate system (with a _size_ property, and **BoxConstraint** _constraints_ property inherited from parent)
* **RenderObject** = counterpart of **RenderObjectElement** (but not **ComponentElement**) in a **RenderTree**, abstract model for layout and painting
  * Render tree object handling concrete operations (layout, painting, hit testing, accessbility) without child model (undefined child/children/named children) nor coordinate system (Cartesian/polar)
  * Paints UI via dedicated subclasses that can handles size, layout, painting (eg **RenderParagraph** renders text, **RenderImage** an image)
  * Everything that we see displayed on screen is a RenderObject
* **RenderObjectElement** = **Element** that uses **RenderObjectWidget** as configuration, with an associated **RenderObject** in render tree, participates in layout/paint phases (ie a leaf element)
* **RenderObjectWidget** = configuration for **RenderObjectElement**
* **RenderTree** = data structure storing UI geometry (computed at layout, used for painting & hit testing)
* **RenderView** = root of all RenderObjects, it total output of Render Tree (its `compositeFrame()` generates a frame to display)
* **Skia** = open-source cross-platform 2D (3D via Vulkan & Metal) GPU-accelerated graphics library to draw stuff, written in C++ (à la Unity, running in web as WebAssembly), also used by Chrome
  * Native Android apps also use Skia as part of their rendering routine, however Flutter packs its own standalone copy (in the engine layer) to remain decouple from a platform's specific version
* **Slivers** = different parts of a scrollable area that can each react appropriately to the same scroll
* **State** = objects associated with stateful widgets (actually linked **from** their associated Elements)
  * _widget_ = access to its associated widget's properties (usually passed down from parent)
  * _context_ = access to its associated widget's context (ie outside of `build()`, declare `late final` variables to use in an initializer)
  * `build()` = called by Flutter (and never directly!), possibly very often whenever it needs to paint something (ie `setState()` called, or parent input data changes, or once during app creation)
    * Always return a new or cached (tree of) widget(s), ie it constitutes a reactive snapshot of UI
  * `setState()` = [takes in & executes an anonymous method, mostly contains _asserts_, then marks the Element dirty](https://iiro.dev/set-state)
    * State (aka private variables) can be managed in any Dart class really, but `setState()` is what Flutter does need to update UI
  * _Lifting state up_ = moving state up to first common ancestor; basic solution to fix state sharing between multiple widgets
  * State is persistent between widget tree rebuilds (eg a few parts of the screen gets updated), but not navigating to a whole different page, which replaces subtrees
* **State Restoration** = restoring state after app was backgrounded/suspended by OS (**RestorationManager**, `with RestorationMixin` > `restoreState()`)
* **WebGL** = JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D/3D graphics with GPU-accelerated physics to web browsers (ie HTML canvas) without plugins
* **Widget** = immutable (declarative) description of part of a UI (layout component or behavior: center, pad, rotate)
  * _Everything is a widget_, including app itself
  * All Widgets are @`immutable`, holding only `final` data, so any mutating data has to be outsourced into a dedicated mutable **State**
  * Although already instantiated widgets are immutable, `build()` can return new widgets (subtree) each time as old ones get discarded
  * Widgets - or State -, **not Elements**, hold properties with actual values
  * [Stateless Widget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE7khGHVkYY) = immmutable widget w/ `final` properties & `const` constructor
    * Those get rebuilt (aka replaced) when the input data from their parent changes, ie when their parent rebuilds
    * A widget tree composed of only _stateless_ widgets therefore never updates
    * All visual elements such as buttons, texts are stateless widgets
  * [Stateful Widget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqCMFXEmf3w) = (also!) immutable widget associated with a companion class called State that holds changing data, `build()` & `setState()` methods
  * [Inherited Widget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm3hjPjQMk) = DYI DI via _context_
    * Inherited Widget takes at least one parameter: a _child_ (ie its sub-tree that gets notified) which is passed to `super()`
    * Define `of()` shorthand method eg `static InheritedNose of(BuildContext context) => context.inheritFromWidgetOfExactType(InheritedNose)`
    * **Theme**, **MediaQuery** are examples of Inherited Widgets, accessible to all children in their hierarchy
      * Eg `Theme.of(context).primaryColor`
    * Use this to pass DB or service instances down the widget hierarchy
    * For more complex scenarios, use an integrated State Management solution instead
* **Widget Tree** = perhaps counte-intuitively, a widget tree is _contructed_ top-down (this gives child widgets access to their ancestors via BuildContext)

### [Constraints & Layout](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals/layout)

* [Constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/constraints) = min/max height/width dimension constraints cascading down widget tree from parents to children
  * **Loose constraints** = constraints allowing a range of possible values (ie **min < max**)
  * **Tight constraints** = constraints defined as a single point (ie **min == max**, eg **App** root widget must fit the whole screen exactly)
  * **Unbounded constraints** = maximum height and/or width is set to _double.infinity_, which is intended for inflexible widgets to define their own size
    * If inflexible children decrease available space too much, first all flex children get compressed to 0 pixels, then inflexible children get clipped at the edge (with a black/yellow warning in debug mode)
    * Flex children appearing in this context cause an error
* **Composition** = overlaying visual elements in draw order (into a single image)
* [Layout](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout) = positioning & sizing elements (_where & how big everything is_)
  * Parent-child layout conversation: _Constraints go down. Sizes go up. Parent sets the position_:
    1. child receives constraints (ie set of 4 doubles: min/max height & width) from parent
    2. child determines its size, passes it back up
    3. parent determines child positionsheila
* **Paint** = converting elements into visual representation (_determining visual appearance_), prepares different layers for compositing, isolates unchanged subtrees
* **Rasterizing** = translates output into GPU render instructions (ie pixels)
* **Rendering** = layout + paint + composition
* [Shrink-wrap](https://flutteragency.com/what-does-the-shrink-wrap-property-does) = force a widget to pre-calculate its total size ~ its items

### Lifecycles

* App
  * **WidgetsBindingObserver** = mixin to observe various lifecycle events affecting overall app/widget tree (eg entering back/foreground, screen orientation/size, text scale factor, Android back button)
    * Set `WidgetsBinding.instance.add|removeObserver(this)` & override `didChangeAppLifecycleState(state)`
  * `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` = make sure there is an instance of **WidgetsBinding**, needed to use platform channels to call native code asynchronously (ie if _main_ is `async`)
* Widget = `createState()` = other than that they don't have a lifecycle as they're immutable, they exist or they don't and that's the end of it
* State
  * `initState()` = one-time init
  * `didChangeDependencies()` = when a dependency changes (eg an **InheritedWidget** in `build()` changes), called immediately after `initState()`
  * `didUpdateWidget()` = whenever (associated stateful) widget configuration changes (eg its input values)
    * There's always a rebuild performed after this method
  * `void dispose()` = widget removed from UI (always dispose controllers, focus nodes, streams, etc)
  * _mounted_ (bool) = true if this state is associated with a **BuildContext** (ie after creation/construction, ie before `initState()`, and until `dispose()` gets called)
* StatefulElement = _initial_ (created not mounted/attached), _active_ (mounted to tree), _inactive_ (temporarily removed), _defunct_ (removed permanently)
