# [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

A back-end JavaScript runtime environment (built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine) that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

It can be used a JS-based event-friendly REST API server, or more commonly for its (server-side) front-end building functionalities (see _lscho_'s answer [here](https://developpaper.com/question/what-is-vue-js-why-install-it-in-nodejs/)), such as NPM, Webpack - both of which are written in JS and thus necessitate a runtime to run in -, etc.
