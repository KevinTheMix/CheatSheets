* [Web Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage) = `localStorage` (persistent per same origin) & `sessionStorage` (tab)

* **CDN** (Content Distribution Network) = cloud-backed geographically-distributed data provider (eg **CloudFlare**)
* **SaaS** = Software as a Service aka Software on demand. Subscription-based web app
* **IaaS** = Infrastructure as a Service, a cloud-based VM to setup & install apps on
* **BaaS** = Backend as a Service (eg **FireBase**)
* **PaaS** = Platform as a Service, a (DB/.NET/Java) platform space/repo on which to deploy such apps
* **Serverless computing** = cloud servers that are virtualized and treated as a single pay-per-use platform instead of discrete units
* **No-code** = application creation via visual-based GUIs rather than programming, aimed at businesses
