## Glossary

* **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format) = a Unix executable file
* **GNU** (GNU's Not Unix) = collection of free software launched by Richard Stallman in 1983, a set of user-space tools added to most Linux kernels (eg gcc, Bash) under GNU GPL
* **EUID** (Effective User ID) = actual user ID a process is running under, usually same as UID (but can be different when eg `sudo`)
* **IPC** (Inter-Process Communication) = eg pipes
* **Linux** = independant open-source re-implementation of Unix-like kernel by Linus Torvalds in 1991, released under GNU GPL
* **Orphan Process** = child process whose parent has died (terminated before child), automatically adopted & cleaned by `init` or more modern `systemd` (ie common ancestor of all processes with PID _1_)
* **Pipe** = kernel(-space) managed memory buffered stream between one process _stdout_ to another _stdin_ (ie a unidirectional synchronous IPC)
  * Producer process must first feed a pipe, ie flushing its internal user-space data into kernel-space pipe
  * **Anonymous Pipe** = stored in memory, exists only during lifetime of pipe-using processes (eg `a | b`)
  * **Named Pipe** (aka **FIFOs**) = appear as FS node but data actually also passed in memory via which unrelated processes can read/write (exist until deleted)
* **POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface) = family of standards for compatilibity between OSes (eg APIs, CLI shells commands, utility interfaces )
* **Root** = built-in/default administrative user account in Unix/POSIX, with special UID _0_ (usually only one for security purposes, but more can be added to _/etc/passwd_), that carry superuser role
  * Its home directory is _/root_ (kept outside of _/home_ so always available even if user partitions are not mounted)
* **Shebang** = starting characters of a script used by OS kernel to determine which shell/utility will run that script
  * `#!/usr/bin/{command} -w` = specify command absolute location (with warnings `-w`)
  * `#!/usr/bin/env {command}` = use the environment to find command (can differ per user, and arguments eg `-w` cannot be provided)
* [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#POSIX_signals) = asynchronous message/notification sent to process to trigger specific behavior (eg quitting, error handling)
  * _SIGINT_ = interrupts aprocess (like via `Ctrl + C`)
  * _SIGKILL_ = terminates immediately & forcibly, without time to cleanup
  * _SIGTERM_ = signal to terminate (can be ignored by the process)
* **Standard I/O/Err** = special file descriptors associated with a (single) process (not actual disk files, actually connected to terminal, pipes, sockets, etc, but managed by OS like file handles so we can read/write)
* **Stream** = continuous flow of data where programs can read/write (concurrently in some cases eg pipes) in real-time, typically through standard I/O, pipes & files
* **Superuser** = role/level of privilege that has full control over the system (ie can read/write/execute anything and change any system setting)
  * Not necessarily tied to a single account, can be any process with UID _0_ (ie **root**) or any user with temporary elevated administrative privilege (via `sudo`)
* **Syscall** = request by a user-space program to a kernel service (eg `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `execve()`, `mmap()` memory allocation, `open()`, `unlink()`, `socket()`, `bind()`)
* **Teletypewriter** = an ancient electromechanical printer-keyboard device
* Terminals
  * **Hardware Terminal** = old-ass physical device (keyboard + printer/screen) letting a human talk to a multi-user computer/mainframe over a serial line
  * **TTY** (Teletypewriter) = any (hardware or software) text terminal, a special kernel device file (eg _/dev/tty_, _/dev/tty1_, _/dev/pts/3_, etc) from which shells can read/write
  * **Terminal Emulator** = software GUI that imitates vintage hardware terminals by opening a pseudo-terminal so programs think they interact with a real tty, translating stream of I/O control codes into pixels
  * **Pseudo-Terminal** (PTY) = pair of kernel objects making (master) applications (eg `ssh`, `tmux`, a new terminal tab) believe they interact with a human (TTY) whereas it is another (slave) program
    * Slave end  (_/dev/pts/N_) = looks exactly like a real tty device but real I/O originates from another program launched by user (eg `shell`, `ssh`, `top`, `vim`)
    * Master end  (_/dev/pts/ptmx_) = owned by terminal emulator
* **tmpfs** = RAM-based filesystem (stores files in memory, not disk)
* **Unix** = original OS family developed by AT&T Bell Labs in 1970, with most variants being propriertary (eg Solaris)
* **Useless Use Of Cat** (UUOC) = jargon describing piping a cat command (`cat file | cmd`) in place of a more efficient yet less legible shell open (`cmd < file`)
* **Zombie Process** = completed but its entry still exists in process table (until parent uses `wait()`)

* _BusyBox_ = several (300) Unix common command utilities in a single executable file (aka _"The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux"_)
* _Cygwin_ = FOSS & Linux-like tools for Windows
* _WebMin_ = web-based (ie webpages) server management control panel for Unix systems (eg users, disk quotas, services, config files)
* _Wine_ = FOSS compatibility layer between Windows applications/games and Unix-like OSes (ie Linux & macOS)

  * `-w` = ask for confirmation for every action
  * `-x` = extract/untars
  * `-z` = applies _gzip_ compression
* `tee` = read _stdin_, write to _stdout_ & files simultaneously (ie useful for logging, `-a` append)
* `timeout {duration} {command}` = run a command with a time limit (ie start command & kills it if still running after duration)
* `tmux` = terminal multiplexer (create & access several terminals from a single screen, actually a shell itself)
  * `tmux ls` or `tmux list-sessions` = list all sessions managed by server
  * `tmux attach -t {session_id}` = re-enter a session
  * `tmux kill-session -t {session_id}` = kill a session
  * `Ctrl + B` = prefix key to launch a control commands
    * `"` = split window vertically
    * `{arrow}` or `o` = select pane
    * `d` = detach current client (session keeps on running)
  * Also offers scripting commands
* `top` = running processes with PID, CPU, memory usage (Ã  la Windows Task Manager, see `htop`)
* `touch {file(s)}` = creates one or multiple empty files, or update existing files access/modification times
  * `f1 f2 f3` = creates multiple files
  * `prefix{i..n}` (literal curly braces) = creates multiple files
  * `-d tomorrow koko` = creates file with given creation date
* `tput` = use terminal capabilities (eg clear screen, move cursor, indicate number of lines/columns, bolden text if terminal supports it)
* `tr {from} {to}` = (translate/delete) characters manipulation (eg `tr a-z A-Z` uppercase, `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'` ROT13)
* `traceroute` (installable) = determines route a packet takes to a destination (uses ICMP)
* `tty` = print file name of the terminal (if any) connected to (my program's) standard input
* `ufw` = sets firewall config (uses `iptables`)
* `uname` = display system information (`-a` all, `-n` system (host) name, also see `neofetch` utility)
* `uniq {file}` = report/omit repeated lines (`-u` only unique lines)
* `unmount` (installable)
* `uptime` = show session uptime
* `vi(m)` = Vi IMproved
* `vimtutor` = Vim tutorial
* `vigr` = edit _/etc/group_
* `vipw`= edit _/etc/passwd_
* `w` = shows who is logged and what they are doing
* `wall` = write a message to all users
* `wc` = counts a file's total lines, words, bytes/characters, by default as a 4-columnar output
* `wget {file}` = downloads file
  * `-c {file}` = continue stopped download
  * `-r {url}` = recursively downloads files from url
* `whatis {command}` = one-line summary of command
* `whereis {command}` = locate binary, source & man pages for a command
* `which {command}` = locate a command (eg `which $SHELL`)
* `who` = information about users currently logged in
  * `-q` = all login names + number of users logged on
  * Eg `who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq` = display sorted unique login names
* `whoami` = user name associated with current effective user ID
* `whois {domain}` (installable) = opens a TCP socket, calls a WHOIS server, and prints result
* `write` = sends a message to another user
* `xxd` = hex dump (& reverse)
* `(un)zip`

#### System Calls

* `brk()`/`sbrk()` = (_obsolete_) controls heap size
* `exec_()` = standard C library functions family
  * This creates a new process in same memory space, replacing existing segments in memory, but keeping original PID
* `execve(file, argv, envp)` = executes program by path, replacing current process
* `execvp(file, argv)`
* `fork()` = creates a new process (**returns** _0_ in child and child's PID in parent) with virtual memory copy of its parent until a write operation is performed (aka copy-on-write)
  * Children inherit their parent's file-descriptor table entries, so all stdout arrive in same open-file object (so all outputs go to same terminal/file)
* `mmap()` = maps a region of of a process virtual memory (address space) & a source of data (ie a file/device or anonymous memory via local pointer)
* `wait()` = wait for first child to die
* `waitpid({pid})` = wait for specific pid
