# Unix

## Quick Tips

* `~{user}` = shortcut for _/home/{user}_ (of course `~` is shorter for self)
* `~/.bash_history` = user history of Bash commands
* [bash](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/bash.git)
* [GNU Core Utilities](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils)
* [Bash Prompt HOWTO](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/index.html)
* `({cmd1}; {cmd2})` = creates new shell (_sh_), executes both commands, close shell

## Glossary

* **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format) = a Unix executable file
* **GNU** (GNU's Not Unix) = collection of free software launched by Richard Stallman in 1983, a set of user-space tools added to most Linux kernels (eg gcc, Bash) under GNU GPL
* **Here Document** = file or input stream literal
* **Here String** = one-line heredoc
* **EUID** (Effective User ID) = actual user ID a process is running under, usually same as UID (but can be different when eg `sudo`)
* **IPC** (Inter-Process Communication) = eg pipes
* **Linux** = independant open-source re-implementation of Unix-like kernel by Linus Torvalds in 1991, released under GNU GPL
* **Orphan Process** = child process whose parent has died (terminated before child), automatically adopted & cleaned by `init` or more modern `systemd` (ie common ancestor of all processes with PID _1_)
* **Pipe** = kernel(-space) managed memory buffered stream between one process _stdout_ to another _stdin_ (ie a unidirectional synchronous IPC)
  * Producer process must first feed a pipe, ie flushing its internal user-space data into kernel-space pipe
  * **Anonymous Pipe** = stored in memory, exists only during lifetime of pipe-using processes (eg `a | b`)
  * **Named Pipe** (aka **FIFOs**) = appear as FS node but data actually also passed in memory via which unrelated processes can read/write (exist until deleted)
* **POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface) = family of standards for compatilibity between OSes (eg APIs, CLI shells commands, utility interfaces )
* **Root** = built-in/default administrative (super)user account in Unix/POSIX
  * All root users are superusers (with UID _0_) but the opposite is not true (they are all equivalent in power)
  * Home directory is _/root_ (kept outside of _/home_ so always available even if user partitions are not mounted)
* **Shebang** = starting characters of a script used by OS kernel to determine which shell/utility will run that script
  * `#!/usr/bin/{command} -w` = specify command absolute location (with warnings `-w`)
  * `#!/usr/bin/env {command}` = use the environment to find command (can differ per user, and arguments eg `-w` cannot be provided)
* [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#POSIX_signals) = asynchronous message/notification sent to process to trigger specific behavior (eg quitting, error handling)
  * _SIGINT_ = interrupts aprocess (like via `Ctrl + C`)
  * _SIGKILL_ = terminates immediately & forcibly, without time to cleanup
  * _SIGTERM_ = signal to terminate (can be ignored by the process)
* **Standard I/O/Err** = special file descriptors associated with a (single) process (not actual disk files, actually connected to terminal, pipes, sockets, etc, but managed by OS like file handles so we can read/write)
* **Stream** = continuous flow of data where programs can read/write (concurrently in some cases eg pipes) in real-time, typically through standard I/O, pipes & files
* **Superuser** = any process running with special UID _0_ (eg **Root** or via `sudo`, but more can be added to _/etc/passwd_)
  * Any user/process with UID _0_ has full control over the system (ie can read/write/execute anything and change any system setting)
* **Syscall** = request by a user-space program to a kernel service (eg `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `execve()`, `mmap()` memory allocation, `open()`, `unlink()`, `socket()`, `bind()`)
* **Teletypewriter** = an ancient electromechanical printer-keyboard device
* Terminals
  * **Hardware Terminal** = old-ass physical device (keyboard + printer/screen) letting a human talk to a multi-user computer/mainframe over a serial line
  * **TTY** (Teletypewriter) = any (hardware or software) text terminal, a special kernel device file (eg _/dev/tty_, _/dev/tty1_, _/dev/pts/3_, etc) from which shells can read/write
  * **Terminal Emulator** = software GUI that imitates vintage hardware terminals by opening a pseudo-terminal so programs think they interact with a real tty, translating stream of I/O control codes into pixels
  * **Pseudo-Terminal** (PTY) = pair of kernel objects making (master) applications (eg `ssh`, `tmux`, a new terminal tab) believe they interact with a human (TTY) whereas it is another (slave) program
    * Master end  (_/dev/ptmx_) = owned by terminal emulator
    * Slave end  (_/dev/pts/N_) = looks exactly like a real tty device but real I/O originates from another program launched by user (eg `shell`, `ssh`, `top`, `vim`)
* **tmpfs** = RAM-based filesystem (stores files in memory, not disk)
* **Unix** = original OS family developed by AT&T Bell Labs in 1970, with most variants being propriertary (eg Solaris)
* **Useless Use Of Cat** (UUOC) = jargon describing piping a cat command (`cat file | cmd`) in place of a more efficient yet less legible shell open (`cmd < file`)
* **Zombie Process** = completed but its entry still exists in process table (until parent uses `wait()`)

* _BusyBox_ = several (300) Unix common command utilities in a single executable file (aka _"The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux"_)
* _Cygwin_ = FOSS & Linux-like tools for Windows
* _WebMin_ = web-based (ie webpages) server management control panel for Unix systems (eg users, disk quotas, services, config files)
* _Wine_ = FOSS compatibility layer between Windows applications/games and Unix-like OSes (ie Linux & macOS)

### Distros

* **File Descriptor** = a small non-negative integer that a process uses to refer to an open file object inside kernel
  * Every new process starts with three already-open descriptors (stdin _0_, stdout _1_, and stderr _2_ as a parallel channel to provide non-necessarily error-related feedback)
* **File Object** = anything that implements byte-stream interface (eg file, directory, block/character devices, pipes/fifos, sockets)

  * **User** = creator, **Group** = group User belongs to, **Other** = everyone who has access (ie an account) on the system
  * **Read** = can view & copy contents
  * **Write** = can modify & delete (needs execute permission as well) content

  * _t_ (eg _drwxrwxrwt_) = **Sticky Bit** = special mode for directories (& rarely files) that restricts unlinking (aka deleting) & renaming its entries
    * Only file owner, directory owner or _root_ can delete/rename entries (no other users even with write persmissions)

* _/_ (root) = top
* _boot_ = static files needed for initial boot stage (ie kernel images, bootloader configuration)
* _bin_ & _sbin_ = minimal set of essential user command binaries (eg `ls`, `cp`, `sh`) & system binaries (eg `fsck`, `iptables`), available during boot/rescue

  * _/dev/sda_ = device-file handle for first SCSI-class block disk Linux kernel discovers at boot/when hot-plugged
* _etc_ = host-specific system-wide configuration files & startup scripts (_/etc/ssh/sshd\_config_)
  * _/etc/group_ = plain-text mapping DB of group names to IDs & defaults, only editable by **root** (via `vigr`)
  * _/etc/nologin_ = presence of this file prevents unprivileged users from logging into the system (useful to temporarily disable all unprivileged login ie non-root users)
  * _/etc/passwd_ = plain-text mapping DB of user names to IDs & defaults (home dir, login shell), only editable by **root** (via `vipw`)
  * _/etc/os-release_ =  OS version information
  * _/etc/shells_ = list of valid login shells (any script can be added here, even those that exit immediately)
* _home_ = default location for regular users personal directories & data (ie _/home/{user}_)
* _lib_ & _lib64_ = shared libraries & kernel modules needed by programs in _/bin_ & _/sbin_
* _lost+found_ = automatically created at top of each ext* filesystems; recovered orphaned files found by `fsck`
* _media_ = automated mounting of removable media (CD-ROMs, USB drives), by GUI desktop environment or system services (eg `udisks`)
* _mnt_ = manual mounting by (sys)administrators
* _opt_ = optional ad-on software packages installed outside system's package manager (eg _/opt/{package}_)
* _proc_ = pseudo-filesystem exposing kernel & process informations as files

  * _/proc/{PID}/maps_ = live view of every virtual memory region mapped by Kernel into process' address space
  * _/proc/cpuinfo_ = CPU cores information
* _root_ =  home directory for the _root_ user (keep separate from _/home_ for security & availability during single-user maintenance reasons)
* _run_ = early-boot temporary state like PID files & sockets, actually a tmpfs (ie stored in RAM) so cleared at reboot
* _srv_ = system-served data (eg web, FTP, rsync repos)
* _sys_ = another virtual filesystem presenting hardware/driver details, reflecting the kernel's device-model tree
* _tmp_ = temporary files that may be deleted at reboot
* _usr_ = read-only shareable data & programs for normal operation
  * _/usr/bin_ contains ordinary user programs (not required for boot/rescue)
* _var_ = variable data that changes at run-time (eg logs, spool files, caches, mail queues, DBs, PID files)
  * _/var/spool_ = location where producer-consumer can meet & queue/consume data, surviving reboots (unlike _/tmp_)

* `ufw` = sets firewall config (uses `iptables`)
* `uname` = display system information (`-a`=all, `-n`=system (host) name, also see `neofetch` utility)
* `uniq {file}` = report/omit repeated lines (`-u` only unique lines)
* `vi(m)` = Vi IMproved
* `vimtutor` = Vim tutorial
* `vigr` = edit _/etc/group_
* `vipw`= edit _/etc/passwd_
* `wall` = write a message to all users
* `wc` = counts a file's total lines, words, bytes/characters, by default as a 4-columnar output
* `wget` = web request
* `whatis {command}` = one-line summary of command
* `whereis {command}` = displays all locations where command is located
* `which {command}` = locate a command (eg `which $SHELL`)
* `who` = information about users currently logged in
  * `-q` = all login names + number of users logged on
  * Eg `who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq` = display sorted unique login names
* `whoami` = user name associated with current effective user ID
* `whois` = opens a TCP socket, calls a WHOIS server, and prints result
* `write` = sends a message to another user
* `xxd` = hex dump (& reverse)
* `(un)zip`

#### System Calls

* `brk()`/`sbrk()` = (_obsolete_) controls heap size
* `exec_()` = standard C library functions family
  * This creates a new process in same memory space, replacing existing segments in memory, but keeping original PID
* `execve(file, argv, envp)` = executes program by path, replacing current process
* `execvp(file, argv)`
* `fork()` = creates a new process (**returns** _0_ in child and child's PID in parent) with virtual memory copy of its parent until a write operation is performed (aka copy-on-write)
  * Children inherit their parent's file-descriptor table entries, so all stdout arrive in same open-file object (so all outputs go to same terminal/file)
* `mmap()` = maps a region of of a process virtual memory (address space) & a source of data (ie a file/device or anonymous memory via local pointer)
* `wait()` = wait for first child to die
* `waitpid({pid})` = wait for specific pid
