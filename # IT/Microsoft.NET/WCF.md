# WCF

* **WcfTestClient** = test web service APIs (_C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\WcfTestClient.exe_)
* `using (OperationContextScope service = new OperationContextScope((IContextChannel)this.service))` where service is a referenced service contract
* Providing an endpoint name in code will override the service client configuration generated by Visual Studio when the service reference was added with the corresponding endpoint configuration from _web.config_
  * `var service = new RemoteWebServiceClient("MyEndpoint");` will use the alternate configuration defined in web.config and not the service reference parameters
