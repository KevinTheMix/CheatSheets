# .NET

## Quick Tips

* (Legacy) register a particular installed version of .NET into IIS: `C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe -i`

## Glossary

* **ASP.NET** (_.ascx_ = custom user control, _.ashx_ = lightweight UI-less control)
* **ASP.NET Core** = formerly **ASP.NET** (still carrying the _Core_ nametag for the time being)
  * **ASP.NET Core 3+** = now depend on **.NET (Core)** (and can no longer be used on earlier .NET Framework)
  * **ASP.NET Razor** = programming syntax (using C#/VB) used to create dynamic pages
  * MVC Controllers = in any folder (**Controllers** by convention), _can_ inherit from `Controller`, _must_ end with `_Controller`, returns data or a view (MVC) or HTTP methods (WebApi)
  * MVC Models = in any folder (**Models** by convention)
  * MVC Views = Razor page, _must_ be in **Views** folder, in a sub-folder with same name as associated Controller (eg `Views/Koko/Index.cshtml` linked with `KokoController`)
  * MVC Helpers eg `Html.ActionLink("Go to koko", "Index", "Koko", new {...} )` = creates link to `Index()` method of _Koko_ Controller with optionally provided parameters
* **.NET Foundation** = independant open-source community-driven non-profit organization to support .NET innovation ecosystem
* **.NET Framework** = main implementation of CLI until being superseded by the cross-platform **.NET** (Core)
  * [Wikipedia - Version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history)
* **.NET** (formerly **.NET Core**) = FOSS managed cross-platform (ie Windows, Linux and macOS) redesign & replacement of **.NET Framework**
  * It is a runtime for .NET applications based on libraries simplification and standardization efforts (through ECMA), especially efficient in a microservices, containerized environment
  * _.Net Core 3_ (2019) = introduces C# 8, and desktop technologies (UWP & WPF), prior to version 3, Core apps could run atop (target) either the .NET Core or good old .NET Framework runtime
  * _.Net Core 3.1_ (2019) = last version of _.NET Core_ under that denomination
  * _.NET 5_ (2020)
  * _.NET 6_ (2021)
  * _.NET 7_ (2022)
  * _.NET 8_ (2023)
  * _.NET 9_
  * _.NET 10_
* **.NET Standard** = theoretical formal standard specification (of libraries) to which specific implementations can adhere (**.Net framework** or **.NET Core** at the time)
  * Created in order to establish greater uniformity, up until last version 2.1 (now superseded by **.NET 5**'s CLI **Standard Libraries**)
* **Blazor** = FOSS web framework used to create interactive web UI (using C# and HTML)
* **CLI** (Common Language Infrastructure) = ECMA open standard originated by Microsoft to describe multiple high-level languages running on different platforms (eg .NET (Framework), Mono)
* **CIL** (Common Intermediate Language) = bytecode intermediary language
* `EventSource` (_System.Diagnostics.Tracing_) = base class for creating events for tracing across platforms
* **Publish** = package an application as _self-contained_ (larger as it includes runtime itself) or _framework-dependent_ (requires prinstalled .NET runtime, **mandatory for development purposes**)
  * See [Microsoft - Application publishing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying)
* **Standard Libraries** = set of libraries included in the CLI encapsulating common functions such as file read/writing, XML manipulation, exception handling, network communication, threading, reflection

## API

These can also be run from Visual Studio:

* `dotnet --help`
* `dotnet new console -n "Project Name"` = new project of type _console_
* `dotnet new mstest`
* `dotnet run` = runs current project (as a DLL, not an _exe_, since it's _platform independant_)
* `dotnet test` = runs a test project
* `dotnet add package Newtonsoft.json --version 11.0.2`
* `dotnet build`
* `dotnet pack` = builds nuget (as defined in _.csproj_) into `bin\Debug`
* `dotnet publish` = publishes to current platform (transforms multi-platform independant DLL into platform specific _exe_-like in _bin\Debug_)
* `dotnet publish -r(untime) {RID}` = publishes to target platform (where RID is Runtime Identifier eg `win-x64`)

### DI

* `AddTransient()` = shared/recreated each time
* `AddSingleton()` = single instance passed around
* `services.Configure<MyOptions>(this.Configuration.GetSection(""))` = read configuration section
