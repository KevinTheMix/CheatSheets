# .NET

* (Legacy) register a particular installed version of .NET into IIS: `C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_regiis.exe -i`

## Glossary

* _ASP.NET Core_ = formerly _ASP.NET_ (still carrying the _Core_ nametag for the time being)
  * _ASP.NET Core 3+_ = now depend on _.NET (Core)_ (and can no longer be used on earlier .NET Framework)
  * _ASP.NET Razor_ = programming syntax (using C#/VB) used to create dynamic pages
  * MVC Controllers = in any folder (**Controllers** by convention), _can_ inherit from `Controller`, _must_ end with `_Controller`, returns data or a view (MVC) or HTTP methods (WebApi)
  * MVC Models = in any folder (**Models** by convention)
  * MVC Views = Razor page, _must_ be in **Views** folder, in a sub-folder with same name as associated Controller (eg `Views/Koko/Index.cshtml` linked with `KokoController`)
  * MVC Helpers eg `Html.ActionLink("Go to koko", "Index", "Koko", new {...} )` = creates link to `Index()` method of _Koko_ Controller with optionally provided parameters
* _.NET Foundation_ = independant open-source community-driven non-profit organization to support .NET innovation ecosystem
* _.NET Framework_ = main implementation of CLI until being superseded by the cross-platform _.NET_ (Core)
  * [Wikipedia - Version history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework_version_history)
* _.NET_ (formerly _.NET Core_) = **FOSS**, **managed** & **cross-platform** (for Windows, Linux and macOS) redesign & replacement of _.NET Framework_
  * It is a runtime for .NET applications based on libraries simplification and standardization efforts (through ECMA), especially efficient in a microservices, containerized environment
  * _.Net Core 3_ (2019) = introduces C# 8, and desktop technologies (UWP & WPF), prior to version 3, Core apps could run atop (target) either the .NET Core or good old .NET Framework runtime
  * _.Net Core 3.1_ (2019) = last version of _.NET Core_ under that denomination
  * _.NET 5_ (2020)
  * _.NET 6_ (2021)
  * _.NET 7_ (2022)
  * _.NET 8_ (2023)
  * _.NET 9_
  * _.NET 10_
* _.NET Standard_ = theoretical formal standard specification (of libraries) to which specific implementations can adhere (_.Net framework_ or _.NET Core_ at the time)
  * Created in order to establish greater uniformity, up until last version 2.1 (now superseded by _.NET 5_'s CLI **Standard Libraries**)
* _Blazor_ = FOSS web framework used to create interactive web UI (using C# and HTML)
* **CLI** (Common Language Infrastructure) = ECMA open standard originated by Microsoft to describe multiple high-level languages running on different platforms (eg _.NET (Framework)_, _Mono_)
* **CIL** (Common Intermediate Language) = bytecode intermediary language
* `EventSource` (_System.Diagnostics.Tracing_) = base class for creating events for tracing across platforms
* **Publish** = package an application as _self-contained_ (larger as it includes runtime itself) or _framework-dependent_ (requires prinstalled .NET runtime, **mandatory for development purposes**)
  * See [Microsoft - Application publishing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying)
* **Standard Libraries** = set of libraries included in the CLI encapsulating common functions such as file read/writing, XML manipulation, exception handling, network communication, threading, reflection

## API

These can also be run from Visual Studio:

* `dotnet --help`
* `dotnet new console -n "Project Name"` = new project of type _console_
* `dotnet new mstest`
* `dotnet run` = runs current project (as a DLL, not an _exe_, since it's _platform independant_)
* `dotnet test` = runs a test project
* `dotnet add package Newtonsoft.json --version 11.0.2`
* `dotnet build`
* `dotnet pack` = builds nuget (as defined in _.csproj_) into `bin\Debug`
* `dotnet publish` = publishes to current platform (transforms multi-platform independant DLL into platform specific _exe_-like in _bin\Debug_)
* `dotnet publish -r(untime) {RID}` = publishes to target platform (where RID is Runtime Identifier eg `win-x64`)

### DI

* `AddTransient()` = shared/recreated each time
* `AddSingleton()` = single instance passed around
* `services.Configure<MyOptions>(this.Configuration.GetSection(""))` = read configuration section

## Extensions (Frameworks)

* **.NET MAUI** = neo Xamarin.Forms merged into .NET 6, executes Android, iOS, macOS & Windows via .NET for those platforms
* **Avalonia UI** = open-source pixel-perfect multi-platform .NET apps (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOs, Android, Wasm) based on WPF, part of .NET Foundation
* **Microsoft XNA** = set of free tools & runtime environment developed by _Microsoft Gaming_ to facilitate video game development
* **Mono** = FOSS implementation of .NET (sponsored by _MS_)
* **PowerBuilder** = _SAP_-owned programming language & IDE for developing (`DataWindow`-based) C#.NET compatible applications performing (primarily) CRUD DB operations
* **Uno Platform** = open-source cross-platform pixel-perfect GUI based on WinUI & UWP (ie C# & XAML) - released in 2018 not by Microsoft
* **WinUI** = a user interface API (part of WinRT) based on XAML for previous Windows OS (up to Windows 10)
* **WinRT** (Windows Runtime) = platform-agnostic component & application architecture implemented in C++
* **Windows RT** = a deprecated Windows 8 OS for mobile
