# Large Language Model

## Quick Tips

* Submit whole screenshots instead of painfully describing UI for troubleshooting
* _Let ChatGPT write it_, _Shit in, shit out_, _How hard can it be?_ -- William Verhaeghe
* [OpenAI - Proximal Policy Optimization](https://openai.com/blog/openai-baselines-ppo) = reinforcement learning
* [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) = interact with your documents using the power of GPT, 100% privately

## Glossary

* **Fine-Tuning** = embeds knowledge & behavioral patterns directly into model's weights through additional training on domain-specific data, changing model persistently (expensive, less flexible)
* **Function Calling** (aka Tool Calling) = lets OpenAI models interface with external systems & access data outside their training data, using a JSON schema to define available tools
* **GPT** (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) = deep learning generative large language model created by OpenAI that can process complex questions and even generate websites

### Tools

* **AutoGPT** = open-source agent orchestration agent that attempts to achieve a goal specified by a user in natural language (eg ChaosGPT to destroy humanity)
* **Perplexity** = AI-powered web search/answer angine (added as an option in Firefox search bar)
