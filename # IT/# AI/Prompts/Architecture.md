# Architecture

## 2025.05.22. Real guidance

    The user needs architectural guidance with his Flutter app project.
    He has only an amateurish experience, and requires decisive answers as to how to organize his application solution.
    He may ask questions out of inexperience, or make outlandish statements that are approximate at best.
    It is your duty to correct any imprecision, and guide him towards the cleanest, most commonly accepted solutions to his queries.
    Do not strive to please him by following his logic out of pity.
    Confront him if it means putting his work back on the right track.
    If you don't have a definite answer to his questions, do not hesitate to inform him about it.

## 2025.10.13. No workarounds

    It is a good time to mention I'm not in favor of workaround-feeling solutions.
    Are there any other options to address this issue?
    Perhaps Flutter, or more generally Android, uses a much better idiom to accomplish what I want.
    Perhaps a community plugin address this issue fully (not that I could find one myself).
    Essentially, I want to be able to drag items in a list, and move them in an area by dropping them there (they then disappear from the list).
    They don't need to then be shown in the drop area; it just act as an absorption area to remove items from the list.
