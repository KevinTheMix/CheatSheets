## Quick Tips

* [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) by Andrej Karpathy of OpenAI/Tesla fame
* [Threre's An AI For That](https://theresanaiforthat.com) (TAAFT) = find & compare hundreds of AI tools by features, pricing, etc
* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) = machine learning models collaborative/sharing platform
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com) = run llama2 (uncensored) & other models (Mistral)
* Machine Learning doesn't output data, but code

## Glossary

* **Advantage Actor Critic** (A2C) = reinforcement learning algorithm used for training agents to perform tasks in environments
* **Deep Learning** = ML subset based on artificial neural networks with representation learning
  * **Deep neural network** (DNN) = an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the I/O layers
* **Feature Learning** (aka Representation Learning) = techniques for feature detection or classification of raw data
* **Genetic Algorithm** (GA) = do the evolution baby (eg **NEAT** (_NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies_))
  * Eg [HTML5 Genetic Cars 2](https://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2)
  * Eg [CodinGame Pod Racing](https://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html)
* [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org) = image DB organized according to WordNet hierarchy
* **Machine Learning** (ML) = field of study of AI studying statistical algorithms to learn from existing data then generalize to new data to complete tasks without explicit instructions
* **Neural Network** (NN) or **Artificial Neural Network** (ANN) = branch of ML built on biological (brain) neural organization (ie in/out with math in middle)
  * **Convolutional** = type of NN designed to process high-dimensional data with spatial structure (images/videos/audio/text eg for image recognition, object detection, medical imaging, computer vision)
* **Overfitting** = when an analysis corresponds too closely to a particular set of data (ie its training data) and therefore fails to fit additional data or predict future reliably
* **Reinforcement learning** = no data & no labels but we have ruleset (eg a game), numerical performance score as guidance (eg **Q-learning**)
* **Supervised learning** = we have both in (ie data) & out (ie labels), eg classification (colors), object detection (person, sensor), segmentation (face)
* **Unsupervised learning** = learns from unlabeled/untagged data, through mimicry like people
* [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu) = large English lexical DB (of nouns/verbs/adjectives/adverbs)

* _Label4.ai_ = deepfake detection (audio/image/video/documents) tool by a French company
* _DeepMind_ = British AI company acquired by Google
* _JupyterLab_ = notebooks, code & data with a flexible interface
* _Jupyter Notebook_ = online shared inlined analysis/reporting scripting supporting a variety of programming languages
* _Kaggle_ = platform with common datasets (for training)
* _PyTorch_ = FOSS ML/deep learning framework based on Torch library developed by Meta AI
* _TensorFlow_ = FOSS (Python/JS/C++/Java) library for machine learning, for DNNs training & inference, developed by Google
