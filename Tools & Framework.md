## Network & Security

* OTP (One-Time Pad) = Encryption technique that's unbreakable (even with quantum computing), but necessitate a key that's longer than the message, and that must be passed safely beforehand

* [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)) = network area that's neither internal or public, where public-faced (email/web) servers get placed.
  * Traffic with a DMZ is mostly one-way towards it, i.e. it has very limited connectivity towards the internal network (as much as the firewall allows basically).
  * In a DMZ, clients still connect "directly" (through the firewall) to different servers within the DMZ. That is unlike a reverse proxy that hides all the internal servers behind it.
* [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) = intermediary in a client-server network. Can be forward (at the client) or reverse (at the server).
* [Reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) = server that retrieves resources on behalf of clients from one or more servers, as if they originated from it.
  * Can be used for security (as in a DMZ), caching, logging, monitoring user (employee) activty
