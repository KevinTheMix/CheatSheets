# Design Thinking

## What is a Problem Statement?

A problem statement identifies the gap between the current state (i.e. the problem) and the desired state (i.e. the goal) of a process or product.

* Within the design context, you can think of the user problem as an unmet need. 
* By designing a solution that meets this need, you can satisfy the user and ensure a pleasant user experience

## Next Steps: Understand Problem Space

### Get ideas onto paper

Get the team into the same room and get assumptions, expectations & ideas out of people's heads. Focus on what problem(s) people think your product need to solve.

### Talk to stakeholders

* Understand real constraints on the project
* Understand what their assumptions & expectations of the project
  * It is important to question assumptions and set the expectation that the project will be guided by the discovered real needs of the users. 

### Understand your audiences

* Who do you expect to use your product and why?
  * Be expansive and don't forget about admins, support staff, and other user types.
* Define each audience type in a short and simple way.
* What are their overall goals in using the product?

## Prioritize use cases (audiences & their goals)

* Rank use cases in terms of relative criticality of supporting them (primary/secondary/tertiary)
* Scope product (who will you ultimately support and toward what goals? Why?)
* Create workflow diagrams for each goal
  * These should document how the audience will realistically set out accomplishing their goal (their "workflow") for in-scope use cases.
  * Base this on data and confident assumptions.
  * Keep this implementation-agnostic. You are not trying to design how your users will use your product, but to document how they naturally approach completing their goals.

### Identify unknowns (assumptions and open questions) for prioritized use cases 

* Do they require answers?
* When will answers be necessary?

### Define what success is and how to measure it

* Ask yourself what, from the user’s perspective, is important?
  * Use what you have learned about users to define success from a user experience perspective.
  * Is it that users met their goals?
  * Is it that users feel satisfied?
  * Or is it something else?
* Identify what can be measured to indicate success as you have defined it 
* You don’t have to determine at this time how to gather the metrics, but it is important to know at this stage what will determine whether the product or service was successful, from a user experience perspective. When you are ready for that, however, consider if there are existing metrics, or combination of metrics, in your organization that are a good indicator of success.

### Get buy in

* Go over scoped use cases and success criteria with team & stakeholders.
* Discuss in terms of user-benefit and user-judged success.
* Create plan for addressing any conflicts or feedback.

## Problem Statement Definition

### How to formulate a Problem Statement?

Problem or POV statements can take various formats, but the end goal is always the same: to guide the design team towards a feasible solution. Let’s take a look at some of the ways you might frame your design problem:

* **From the user’s perspective**: “I am a young working professional trying to eat healthily, but I’m struggling because I work long hours and don’t always have time to go grocery shopping and prepare my meals. This makes me feel frustrated and bad about myself.”
* **From a user research perspective**: “Busy working professionals need an easy, time-efficient way to eat healthily because they often work long hours and don’t have time to shop and meal prep.”
* **Based on the four Ws—who, what, where, and why**: “Our young working professional struggles to eat healthily during the week because she is working long hours. Our solution should deliver a quick and easy way for her to procure ingredients and prepare healthy meals that she can take to work.”

### What makes a good Problem Statement?

A good problem statement is human-centered and user-focused. Based on the insights you gathered in the empathize phase, it focuses on the users and their needs—not on product specifications or business outcomes. Here are some pointers that will help you create a meaningful problem statement:

* **Focus on the user**: The user and their needs should be front and center of your problem statement. Avoid statements that start with “we need to…” or “the product should”, instead concentrating on the user’s perspective: “Young working professionals need…”, as in the examples above.
* **Keep it broad**: A good problem statement leaves room for innovation and creative freedom. It’s important to keep it broad enough to invite a range of different ideas; avoid any references to specific solutions or technical requirements, for example.
* **Make it manageable**: At the same time, your problem statement should guide you and provide direction. If it’s too broad in terms of the user’s needs and goals, you’ll struggle to hone in on a suitable solution. So, don’t try to address too many user needs in one problem statement; prioritize and frame your problem accordingly.

## Empathising

Asking the right questions will help you put your finger on the right problem statement. With all your findings from the empathize phase in one place, ask yourself the four Ws: **Who**, **what**, **where**, and **why**?

* **Who is experiencing the problem?** In other words, who is your target user; who will be the focus of your problem statement?
* **What is the problem?** Based on the observations you made during the empathize phase, what are the problems and pain-points that frequently came up? What task is the user trying to accomplish, and what’s standing in their way?
* **Where does the problem present itself?** In what space (physical or digital), situation or context is the user when they face this problem? Are there any other people involved?
* **Why does it matter?** Why is it important that this problem be solved? What value would a solution bring to the user, and to the business?

## Templates

### Problem Statement

* **Business Need** = {product} was designed to achieve {business goals}
* **User Need** = we have observed that {product} has to meet {user goals}, which is causing {negative effects} to business
* **Goal** = How might we deliver {service/product} so that our users are more successful based on {measurable criteria}
  * Potential solution for the business needs
  * Project-related deliverables, as opposed to Business & User needs which can be addressed by different projects.

### Hypothesis Statement

* We believe {doing this} for {these people} will achieve {these outcomes}.
* We will know we are {right/wrong} with {qualitative/quantitative feedback}
