* OTA Updates = Over-the-air updates, the upgrades to the current OS
* ROM (aka Firmware) = basically the OS installed on the device, in its read-only memory. It is a bit ambiguous whether this refers to all images (most likely), or just the _system_ one
  * Stock ROM = orginal factory OEM ROM
  * Custom ROM = ROM not emitted by OEM. Usually contains but a subset of all images (i.e. most importantly a _system_ image), and reuse pre-existing (e.g. stock) images for non-system partitions
* [Rooting](https://www.androidcentral.com/root)

    * Low-level interface used to flash images on a partition via `fastboot` commands
    * Responsible for bringing up the kernel, or launches recovery mode, etc.
    * Responsible for the base layer of security (prevents _system_ change), and unlocking the bootloader erases all previous data
  * Recovery = side menu that can be started from bootloader for disk/partition management (wipe/format)
    * Enter recovery mode by first entering the bootloader, selecting _Recovery mode_
    * [How to enter it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/2akpco/rooted_nexus_5_but_cant_boot_into_recovery/)

      * From there, hold Power and pressing Volume Up **once**
* SafetyNet = feature by which an App required higher security (e.g. banking) can enforce the device is trustworthy
  * I.e. checks the device is not rooted & bootloader is locked
  * Circumventable via microG DroidGuard Helper
* Sideloading = installing an image onto the phone directly from a file located on the PC
* Vendor image = image containing device-specific drivers for controlling GPS, gyro, proximity & co

### [Partitions](https://source.android.com/devices/bootloader/partitions)

* `/boot` = kernel & ramdisk
* `/system` = entire OS outside of kernel
* `/recovery` = recovery
* `/data` (aka userdata) = contacts, messages, settings, apps. Wiping this equals a factory reset.
* `/cache` = frequently accessed data & app components (Ã  la Temp folder)
* `/misc` = important partition - don't remove
* `/radio` = dedicated partition for radio-specific software
* `/vendor` = device-specific drivers for controlling GPS, gyro, proximity & co

### (Stock) Package Structure

This _.zip_ package must first be opened (e.g. in the _platform-tools_ folder) to access the individual ROM & images.

* `{product_name}-{build}.zip`
  * `bootloader-{product_name}-{build}.img`
  * `flash-all.bat`
  * `image-{product_name}-{build}.zip` = stock ROM
    * `boot.img`
    * `cache.img`
    * `recovery.img` = stock recovery
    * `system.img` = OS image
    * `userdata.img`
  * `radio-{product_name}-{build}-{version}.img`

Note that custom ROMs only include the system image.

### [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) (contains ADB, fastboot, systrace)

* In device manager, phones appear with different names depending on device power & (USB debugging session) autorization status
  * Powered-on & authorized phone appears as _Galaxy Nexus_
  * Powered-off or connection not yet accepted (on the device) phone appears as _Android 1.0_
* [How to install ADB and fastboot](https://doc.e.foundation/pages/install-adb-windows)
  * Developer mode must be enabled on the device (by clicking build number 7 times), as well as USB Debugging in developer settings
* [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (aka Android Debug Bridge) = CLI to interact with a (**powered-on**) device
  * `adb devices [-l]` = display connected devices IDs (option: with device information)
  * `adb reboot bootloader` = reboot into the bootloader (alternatively, (re)starting the device while holding Volume Down, then Power)
  * `adb reboot recovery` = reboot into the recovery (alternatively, starting while holding Volume Down, then Power until a menu, then select _RECOVERY_)
  * `adb sideload`
* [Fastboot](http://adbcommand.com/fastboot) = interact with the bootloader (of a **powered-off** device)
  * `fastboot devices [-l]` = display current devices (option: with device information)
  * `fastboot oem unlock` = unlocks the bootloader (**warning: this erases all previous data**), which enables installing a new (custom) OS
    * The _LOCK STATE_ is displayed on the bootloader (lying Android robot) screen
  * `fastboot oem lock` = lock bootloader (**Warning: only lock the bootloader when a Stock OS image is installed, as the last step**)
  * `fastboot reboot` = reboot into the OS
  * `fastboot reboot-bootloader` = reboot into the bootloader
  * `fastboot reboot-recovery` = reboot into the recovery mode (warning: may not work, worse: replace TWRP with the Stock recovery)
  * `fastboot flash [boot|bootloader|radio|recovery|sytem|vendor]` = flash specific image into device partition
    * boot = kernel
    * bootloader = partition management & flash
    * radio = wifi & connectivity
    * recovery = stock or TWRP
    * system = the actual Android system
    * vendor = for newer phones
  * `fastboot -w update` = wipes the device's data, flash & install new firmware
  * [Flashboot Stock to unbrick](https://www.droidwin.com/flash-stock-firmware-via-fastboot-commands/)
* Stock ROM contains `flash-all.bat`, which includes the following commands to automate reinstalling stock Android:
  * `fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-maguro-primemd04.img` = install stock bootloader
  * `fastboot reboot-bootloader` = restart into stock bootloader
  * `fastboot flash radio radio-maguro-i9250xxlj1.img` = install connectivity image (Wi-Fi, mobile data, etc.)
  * `fastboot reboot-bootloader` = restart again
  * `fastboot -w update image-takju-jwr66y.zip` = flash all partitions contained in the _.zip_ file
    * `-w` = Wipe userdata
* Note: Samsung devices come with a unique boot mode called _Download Mode_, very similar to Fastboot mode.
* Heimdall us a cross-platform tool for interacting with Download mode on Samsung devices.
* Odin is a utility used by Samsung to reset (or flash) their smartphones
