# Information Architecture (s important)

/!\ resources management not included (-> PM)

What? -> Blueprint
Record documentation from client & colleague concerns -> blueprint
Form, function, metaphor, nav, IO, interaction, visual design -> blue print

To whom?
How? -> **content & functions**
Build -> skeleton, metaphors, navigation + design

## Goal

* Who?
  * Ideas, opinions, approval
  * Involve people (in)formal

  * Why will people come to your site (product? 1st time? existing site?)
* Ask to Everyone + write Everyone
* Rang (Q -> goals) by Everyone -> list agreed by client

  * \+ screenshots

## Site Content

* Goals + user needs + comp. anal. = list of content & functional requirements
* List += Everyone's list -> review /importance
* Result = content inventory -> check funct. req. (assess time, skill, money, buy/build -> rank)
  * Index cars, grouping**s** & records names by Everyone

* Compare results
  * 1 on 1
  * Everyone
  * Decide pro/cons -> **section/section names** = site structure
