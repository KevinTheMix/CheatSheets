## Q3: .NET Core versioning

Select all that apply

* [False] Before .NET 5, the previous versions of .NET Core were ".NET Core 1", ".NET Core 2", ".NET Core 3" and ".NET Core 4"
* [True] Future versions of .NET Core will be released yearly
* [True] Even-numbered versions will benefit from Long-Term Support (LTS), while odd-numbered will not

## Q4: C# 9.0 Records Part 1

Which are true?

* [True] A record is actually synctactic sugar for a regular class
* [False] A record is immutable, which means once assigned, a record variable cannot be reassigned to a new instance
* [True] `public record Person(string Name);` is a record's valid full definition
* [False] _under_ is a valid keyword that can be used to let records inherit from other records

## Q5: C# 9.0 Records Part 2

* [False] A record definition cannot contain any methods.
* [False] A record is a subtype of struct
* [True] _with_ is a valid keyword that can be used to set certain properties when creating copies of records
* [True] A record is immutable, which means that a record instance cannot be modified past its initialization

## Q6: C# 9.0 & SQL-like

In C# 9.0:

* [False] the following statement is valid: `7 is in (1, 2, 3)`
* [False] SQL-like _case_ & _when_ instructions now exist in C# 9.0
* [True] `if (animal is not Car) { ... }` is a valid instruction
* [True] _and_, _is_, _not_ and _when_ are all valid C# 9.0 keywords

## Q7: C# 9.0 new() Part 1

* [True] ´Dictionary<String, List<ThisIsQuiteTheLongName>> tooLong = new();´ is a valid statement
* [True] `new()` can be passed as a method parameter
* [False] `var a = new (3, 5);` is a valid statement
* [False] `Person p = { Name = "Bill Gates" };` is a valid statement

## Q8: C# 9.0 new() Part 2

* [True] `return new();` is a valid statement in a method
* [False] ´Dictionary<String, List<ThisIsQuiteTheLongName>> tooLong = ();´ is a valid statement
* [True] `Point p = new (3, 5);` is a valid statement
* [True] `Person p = new() { Name = "Satya Nadella" };` is a valid statement

## Q9: C# 9.0 Misc

In C# 9.0:

* [True] `System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` can be the only one statement in a solution, and it will successfully build and run
* [True] _init_ is a valid keyword that can be used to set a property's value during its initialization
* [True] `7 is (>= 0 and < 10)` is a valid statement
* [False] In a solution, the version of compiler used on a given project can be changed via the project' Properties wizard.
* [False] The latest C# 9.0 compiler can be used with older version of the framework e.g. .NET Core 2.x

## Q10: EF6

In a code-first EF6 setup:

* [False] To create a Many-to-Many relationship, an intermediary join table entity **must** manually added and mapped
* [True] A Many-to-Many relationship can be set up by convention if each entity has a collection of the other
* [True] In addition to DB tables and views, entities can also be mapped to an ad hoc inline SQL SELECT query
* [True] Text collations can now be configured programmatically at the database, column or query level
