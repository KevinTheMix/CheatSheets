# Unix

## Quick Tips

* `({cmd1}; {cmd2})` = creates new shell (_sh_), executes both commands, close shell
* [Bash Prompt HOWTO](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/index.html)

## Glossary

* _.{file}_ = hidden file
* _.bashrc_ = personal script automatically configuring environment everytime a new terminal window is opened
* **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell) = an interactive CLI & scripting language shell for UNIX-like OSs (1989)
* **Bourne shell** = shell CLI interpreter by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs (1979)
* **CLI Shell** = command interpreter running inside a terminal that reads/parses/executes commands & print results
  * Provides built-in commands (eg `alias`, `cd`, `echo`), external utilities (`ls`, `cp`, `grep`, `ssh`) & kernel services (`read()`, `write()`, `open()`, `fork`, `clone`)
* **Console** = physical keyboard/display/teletype directly attached to a computer, that receives kernel messages an login prompts
* **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format) = an executable file
* **IPC** (Inter-Process Communication)
* **POSIX** (Portable Operating System Interface) = family of standards for compatilibity between OSes (eg APIs, CLI shells commands, utility interfaces )
* **Root** = built-in administraive user account (effectively, a superuser ie with UID _0_) in Unix/POSIX
  * Can read/write/execute anything and change any system setting
  * Home directory is _/root_ (kept outside of _/home_ so always available even if user partitions are not mounted)
* **Shell** = technically, any outer layer that mediates between a user and a kernel's services
* [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)#POSIX_signals) = asynchronous message/notification sent to process to trigger specific behavior (eg quitting, error handling)
  * _SIGINT_ = interrupts aprocess (like via `Ctrl + C`)
  * _SIGKILL_ = terminates immediately & forcibly, without time to cleanup
  * _SIGTERM_ = signal to terminate (can be ignored by the process)
* **Sourcing** = load & execute a file's contents into current shell session (rather than in a subshell, eg `. ~/.bashrc`)
* **Superuser** = any process running with special UID _0_ (eg **Root** or via `sudo`, but more can be added to _/etc/passwd_)
* Terminals
  * **Hardware Terminal** = physical device (keyboard + printer/screen) letting a human talk to a multi-user computer/mainframe over a serial line
  * **TTY** (Teletypewriter) = in Unix, any (hardware or software) text terminal, a special kernel device file (eg _/dev/tty_, _/dev/tty1_, _/dev/pts/3_, etc) from which interactive/login shells can read inputs
  * **Terminal Emulator** = software GUI that imitates vintage hardware terminals by opening a pseudo-terminal so programs think they interact with a real tty, and translating stream of I/O control codes into pixels
  * **Pseudo-Terminal** (PTY) = a master-slave pair of kernel objects
    * Master end  (_/dev/ptmx_) = owned by terminal emulator
    * Slave end  (_/dev/pts/N_) = looks exactly like a real tty device to whatever program is launched (eg `shell`, `ssh`, `top`, `vim`)
* **Useless Use Of Cat** (UUOC) = jargon describing piping a cat command (`cat file | cmd`) in place of a more efficient yet less legible shell open (`cmd < file`)

* _BusyBox_ = several (300) Unix common command utilities in a single executable file (aka _"The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux"_)
* _Cygwin_ = FOSS & Linux-like tools for Windows
* _WebMin_ = web-based (ie webpages) server management control panel for Unix systems (eg users, disk quotas, services, config files)
* _Wine_ = FOSS compatibility layer between Windows applications/games and Unix-like OSes (ie Linux & macOS)

## File System

* **ext*** = informal shorthand for Linux extended-filesystem family
  * **ext** (**extfs**) = first native, 16MB files, no journaling (1992)
  * **ext2** = 2TB volumes, 4GB files, stable but not journaled (1993)
  * **ext3** = **ext2** + metadata journal enabling faster recovery after crashes (2001)
  * **ext4** = 1EB volumes, 16TB files, extents, delayed allocations, checksums, online defrag (2008-present)
* **Directory** = special file mapping other file names to inodes
* **File-type Indicator** = file (_-_), directory (_d_), symlink (_l_), devices (_c_ & _b_), FIFO/pipe (_p_), socket (_s_)
* **File Mode (String)** = User/Group/Other `rwx` Permissions + Optional attribute
  * **User** = creator, **Group** = group User belongs to, **Other** = everyone who has access (ie an account) on the system
  * **Read** = can view & copy contents
  * **Write** = can modify & delete (needs execute permission as well) content
  * Eg `d-wx` = can add new files, or move/delete existing ones by name (if known), and `cd` to it, but `ls` is not permitted
  * **Execute** = can run an exe file, enter directory (`cd`), and list their permissions (`ls -l`)
  * _s_ = **Owner/Group Execute** (set-UID/GID) = (if user can execute) use owner/group permissions when executing this file
    * Set via octal value _2000_ (group) & _4000_ (owner)
  * _t_ = **Sticky Bit** = special mode (_drwxrwxrwt_) for directories (& rarely files) that restricts unlinking (aka deleting) & renaming its entries
    * Only entry's owner, directory's owner or _root_ can delete/rename entries (no other users even with write persmissions)
    * Eg world-writable directories such as _/tmp_ or _/var/tmp_ where everyone can write but not tamper with others files
    * Set via octal value _1000_
* **Hard Link** = directory entry associating a name with a file (ie another name to same inode)
  * Hard links to directories are usually not permitted (as they can cause a circular structure and interferences with programs)
* **Inode** = data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object (metadata, permissions)
* **Inode Table** = Kernel-managed mapping of inodes to their content on disk
* **Journaling** = crash-consistency using a write-ahead log/journal where sets of planned updates are first written

* _/_ (root) = top
* _boot_ = static files needed for initial boot stage (ie kernel images, bootloader configuration)
* _bin_ & _sbin_ = minimal set of essential user command binaries (eg `ls`, `cp`, `sh`) & system binaries (eg `fsck`, `iptables`), available during boot/rescue
* _dev_ = devices nodes providing user-space interfaces to kernel devices (ie they can be read/written to like a regular file)
  * _/dev/fd0_ = floppy drive
  * _/dev/null_ = special device that discards anything written to it and immediately returns EOF when read
  * _/dev/sda_ = device-file handle for first SCSI-class block disk Linux kernel discovers at boot/when hot-plugged
* _etc_ = host-specific system-wide configuration files & startup scripts (_/etc/ssh/sshd\_config_)
  * _/etc/passwd_ = plain-text mapping database of user names to IDs & defaults, only editable by **root** (via `vipw`)
  * _/etc/group_ = plain-text mapping database of group names to IDs & defaults, only editable by **root** (via `vigr`)
* _home_ = default location for regular users personal directories & data (ie _/home/{user}_)
* _lib_ & _lib64_ = shared libraries & kernel modules needed by programs in _/bin_ & _/sbin_
* _lost+found_ = automatically created at top of each ext* filesystems; recovered orphaned files found by `fsck`
* _media_ = mount points for removable media (CD-ROMs, USB drives), auto-mounted by desktop environments
* _mnt_ = generic mounting point for temp mounting filesystems by administrator
* _opt_ = optional ad-on software packages installed outside system's package manager (eg _/opt/{package}_)
* _proc_ = pseudo-filesystem exposing kernel & process informations as files (eg _/proc/cpuinfo_, per-PID directories)
* _root_ =  home directory for the _root_ user (keep separate from _/home_ for security & availability during single-user maintenance reasons)
* _run_ = early-boot temporary state like PID files & sockets, cleared at reboot
* _srv_ = system-served data (eg web, FTP, rsync repos)
* _sys_ = another virtual filesystem presenting hardware/driver details, reflecting the kernel's device-model tree
* _tmp_ = temporary files that may be deleted at reboot
* _usr_ = read-only shareable data & programs for normal operation
  * _/usr/bin_ contains ordinary user programs (not required for boot/rescue)
* _var_ = variable data that changes at run-time (eg logs, spool files, caches, mail queues, DBs, PID files)
  * _/var/spool_ = location where producer-consumer can meet & queue/consume data, surviving reboots (unlike _/tmp_)
