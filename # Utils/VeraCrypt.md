## Quick Tips

* It's cleaner to remove all Partitions/Volume (in Windows Disk Manager) from the HDD, so it does not appear in Windows
  * Drawback is that Windows will want to format it upon connecting

## USB Key Device

* Add favorite volume = _Favorites_ > _Add Mounted Volume to Favorites..._
  * Check _Mount selected volume when its host device gets connected_
  * Check _Open Explorer Window for selected volume when successfully mounted_
