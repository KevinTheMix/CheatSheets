# C++

* [Array vs Vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_container_(C%2B%2B))
  * Array is compile-time fixed size
  * Vector can resize upon appending elements

## I/O

```C++
int koko;
cin >> koko

cin.get();  // Similar to C#'s Console.ReadKey() to pause a conosle program until a key is pressed.
```
