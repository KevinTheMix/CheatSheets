Introduction
============
# Stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
# Augments regular CSS syntax with programming concepts (e.g. variables, OO, nesting)
# Ultimately, the extended stylsheets are interpreted into regular CSS (e.g. all variables are replaced, unnest, evaluated expressions end up as values)

Variables
	$var = #123456;

Evaluation
	darken([color], 75%)

Nesting
	elem { inside{} }
	# Interpreted to two separate block definitions
	elem {}
	elem inside {}
	
	& refers to the parent selector
