#### Strategy

When approaching enemy bases in "Ghost Recon" as a team of four beginner players, it's important to have a plan and work together. Here are some general tips:

1. Scout the area: Use drones or binoculars to gather intel on the base and its defenses. Identify enemy positions and plan your approach accordingly.
2. Assign roles: Decide who will take on each role, such as a sniper, assault, support, and scout. Make sure everyone knows their responsibilities and how they will contribute to the mission.
3. Communicate: Use in-game voice chat or other communication tools to stay in contact and coordinate your actions. Make sure to call out enemy positions and movements so your teammates can react appropriately.
4. Use stealth: Whenever possible, try to take out enemies silently to avoid alerting others. Use silenced weapons, melee takedowns, and distractions to achieve this.
5. Work together: Coordinate your actions and support each other. Cover each other's backs and work as a team to take down enemies and complete objectives.
6. Plan for contingencies: Have a backup plan in case something goes wrong. Be prepared to adapt to changing situations and work together to overcome any obstacles.

Remember, practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if you fail a few times, keep trying and learning from your mistakes.
