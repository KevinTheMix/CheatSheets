## Glossary

* **A/V** = Audio/Video - unconfirmed
* **AV** = Analog Video, as in _AV Multi Out_, the output of PS1/PS2/PS3
* **RGB** = image format as generated by retro consoles

### Cables

* **Scart** = analog connector popular in Europe, intended as a standard connector to pass all types of audio/video signals through an appropriate subset of its available pins (RBG, Composite)
  * SCART RGB works like Component video, with the Red-Green-Blue sent through separate wires (& pins) through the cable
    * Sync can be sent on a fourth signal for Composite Video (also sent in addition to the 3 RGB signals), which can lead to undesirable graphical artifacts; it is called _Sync-on-Composite_ aka _cvbs_
    * It can also be sent on its own dedicated wire containing both Horizontal & Vertical Sync: _Composite Sync_ aka _CSYNC_, which offers the second best possible sync (behind _separate Sync_ eg VGA)
    * Either of those 2 possibilities require a SCART cable specifically wired for each signal, as they are not compatible with each other
  * Very visually similar with a Japanese cable called JP-21 (that can also output RGB)
  * Uses _Sync-on-luma_
* **Component Video** = any analog video signal split into two or more channels (ie separate _cables_ or individual _pins_ within the same connector), mostly refers to the analog YPbPr component video
* **YPbPr** = Red-Green-Blue cable carrying analog video signal (uses _Sync-on-luma_)
* **S-Video** aka _Separate Video_ or _Y/C_ (for Lumina/Chroma) = single circle cable with 5 pins (**decent** but lower color resolution than component)
* **Composite (Video)** = Yellow(+ White/Red), **bad** because the video's Color, Brightness **and** Sync are sent through the same signal (uses _Sync-on-Composite_)
* **RF** = analog radio signal (à la original NES cable) (**worst**)
* **RCA (Connector)** = individual cable technology used in both Component & Composite (ie each of their audio/video connectors)
  * _Tip_: Yellow-White-Red Composite cables can be substituted as Component cables since the individual cables are the same!

* [My Life in Gaming's Understanding RGB and Sync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAlrdCBjUAQ)
* Modern displays used **p**rogressive interpolation, whilst older CRT used **i**nterlaced interpolation, where only odd/even lines are rendered at each frame cycle
* Most older retro consoles rendered at 240p (eg most PS1 games, but not all - see [List of PS1 games that natively run in 480i](https://shmups.system11.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=54382))
* Most PS2 games are 480i
* [My Life in Gaming's Sony PlayStation 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brMW6KFue-I)
  * It was mostly engineered to output at 480i to cater to contemporary CRTs, but some games could reach 480p (eg God of War - configurable) or even 1080i, while other ran in 240p (eg ICO)
    * [List of PlayStation 2 games with alternative display modes](https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes)
  * (17:30) - Modify resolution by entering game while pressing X & Triangle
  * Plugging YPbPr cable from the PS2 directly into a modern TV lets the TV perform de-interlacing, at the cost of the introduction of noticeable lag
    * Some upscalers do a better job at that conversion step, especially those that can perform Bob Deinterlacing, a form of lag-free line-doubling
  * 480p resolution necessitates at least YPbPr Component (or above: SCART RGB)
  * Component (YPbPr) cable is easier to use, while attaining RGB (via SCART) is more complex
    * The SCART cable must be able to handle RGB (which some cheap ones don't)
    * The SCART cable should have adequate capacitors in regards to the console it's plugged to
      * The PS1 AV output capacitors are not for RGB, therefore the SCART cable has to be equipped with at least ~220 microfarads capacitors
      * The PS2 AV output capacitors for RGB, therefore it does not need capacitors in the SCART cable, but if present, they should be sufficiently powerful not to dim the image (>220 µfarads, eg 1000 µfarads)
    * No PlayStation console has a dedicated Sync signal aka CSYNC, but some SCART contain a Sync stripping circuit to isolate the Sync signal from Luma (if Sync-on-Luma is incompatible)
    * There is no significant advantage using Composite-Sync (CSYNC) over Sync-on-Luma, because luma doesn't contain any color information, which is usually the main source of interference
      * Eg [Sync-on-Luma cable](https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/sony-av-accessories/sony-playstation-1-2-ps1-ps2-rgb-scart-cable-lead) is already fine compared to this more elaborate [CSYNC cable](https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/sony-av-accessories/PlayStation-2-3-RGB-SCART-CABLES/sony-playstation-2-ps2-rgb-scart-cable-composite-sync-CSYNC)
  * (26:30) - There's also a button sequence to reset the PS2 configuration in case it's stuck on no video output
  * (29:50) - [FreeMcBoot](https://freemcboot.net/product.php?id=1) = PS2 homebrew/multi-utility as a memory card
    * contains [GSM (Graphics Synthesizer Mode) Project](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/graphics-synthesizer-mode-selector-gsm.678) = can force the system resoluton to 480p or HD (this only changes the output format, not the game inner resolution)
  * (40:30) - PS2 7000X Slim are the best version of the console (most reliable and most compatible hardware)
    * PS1 games are mostly compatible with PS2, especially the older fat one, also the slim prior to the 750XX series
      * This is because [the PS2 includes the main PS1 processor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/comments/2lk0fr)

## Upscalers

* [RAD2x](https://www.retrorgb.com/rad2x.html) aka _Retro Analog to Digital (with doubling function)_ = plug & play PS1/PS2 to HDMI cable that doubles 240i(PS1)/240p/480i into 480p YPbPr
  * <https://www.retrorgb.com/unveiling-the-rad2x-hdmi-cables.html>
  * Don't forget to switch the video output to RGB in the PS2 menu before connecting the cable
  * Doesn't handle 480p games
  * [UK Purchase](https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/RAD2X-CABLES/SONY-PLAYSTATION-HD-RAD2X-CABLE)
* [RetroTINK](https://www.retrotink.com) = YPbPr/SCART/S-Video/Composite to HDMI/SCART (RGB)
  * [RetroTINK 2x](https://www.retrorgb.com/retrotink2x.html) = good for beginners
  * Typically used in combination with Component YPbPr cables
    * Eg HD Retrovision (or <https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/Component-YPbPr-240p> for other consoles)
  * [US Purchase](https://www.retrotink.com/shop)
    * [RetroTINK-2X Pro](https://www.retrotink.com/product-page/retrotink-2x-pro)
* [HD Retrovision](https://www.hdretrovision.com) = PS2 PS3 to YPbPr Component cable (also exists for SNES)
  * Note: direct YPbPr video is not supported by the PlayStation 1, but a (Genesis) adapter exists
    * [PS1 cables recommendations](https://www.retrorgb.com/playstation1.html)
    * [PS1 Genesis Component cable adapter](https://www.hdretrovision.com/other-consoles/#ps1>)
      * [Purchase](https://castlemaniagames.com/collections/hd-retrovision/products/hd-retrovision-ps1)
    * otherwise most PS2 models can read ([most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_games_incompatible_with_PlayStation_2)) PS1 games
  * [Purchase from US](https://castlemaniagames.com/products/hd-retrovision-ps2-3)
  * [Purchase cheaper from UK](https://8bitmods.com/accessories/hd-retrovision-cables)
  * [Compatibility Test](https://www.hdretrovision.com/240p#test) using Composite cables
* [Open Source Scan Converter (OSSC)](https://www.retrorgb.com/ossc.html) = line multiplier rather than a scaler => no lag (other that the TV), but not compatible with all TVs
  * I/O = SCART/Component/VGA and 240p/480i/480p resolutions into HDMI
  * Uses Bob Deinterlacing
  * Can pass-through (outputs 480i as digital)
* Framemeister aka _XRGB_ (_Micomsoft_) = Japanese upscaler (_discontinued_)
  * [XRGB-3](https://www.junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=XRGB-3)
  * Introduces a ~1.5 frame lag penalty
* [HDMI Adapters](https://www.amazon.fr/s?k=HDMI+Cable+for+Playstation+2)
  * Those simply convert the PS1/PS2 output into a digital (HDMI) signal with no upscaling
  * There are two main types on the market, which are primarily for people with no Component input (and don't want to purchase an upscaler)
    * Type "A" has no 240p (=> ICO won't work, nor any PS1 game), and the image is noisier and darker
    * Type "B" has 240p so games will work **if** the TV accepts 240p over HDMI, and image is not so great either (black levels, aliasing)
