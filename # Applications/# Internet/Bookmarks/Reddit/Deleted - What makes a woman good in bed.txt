From the feedback I've received, the reason I'm "good in bed" is because I moan, but it sounds sincere. [That's because it usually is.] It's also that I actually react. It's not just "oh, oh, oh, oh." It's... being in the moment. Being there with him, experiencing and enjoying it.

My biggest thing is not having sex when I don't want to. If I don't want to get laid, I simply don't. This tactic, I'm sure, has kept me from getting bad "reviews", if you will.

Being more than happy and willing to suck a dick doesn't harm your chances either.

Always being open to their ideas, however weird. At least consider it. And try not to make them feel weird for asking. You're already intimate together, so he may be feeling more honest than normal.

Move a lot. Don't just lay there like a dead fish. Arch your back, curl your heels around his legs and moan as you push his hips into yours. [Don't do that too much, it throws off his rhythm every time you do it.]

What doesn't sound sexy to you isn't what's unsexy to the next human. I used to think my moaning was gross. My VOICE was disgusting. Now? Psh. I have a very sexy voice, moan, body, groove, you name it.

Lastly, asking him how it was for him and if there's anything you could do differently does wonders. Every man is different and will have different preferences. Try not to take anything offensively... unless it's obvious that he's trying to offend. IE, "next time you could be a little less FAT, if you catch my drift."

Oh. PS. It's not just about being hot. I've been with the so called "hotties" even though I'm pretty average looking and a bigger woman. It's about your attitude and confidence. Men see that and are drawn to it like light to the flies. I've even been with guys who were sworn "fatty haters" before me. Two are even chubby chasers now. Take that, society. Changing the world, one dick at a time.
