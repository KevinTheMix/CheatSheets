### IamA 17 year old blind guy who was shot by his father AMA

    Hey buddy, I can relate a little bit as my mother tried to kill me during a suicide bid when I was a kid.
    I know the PTSD and depression from surviving something like that can be terrifying and make you feel like you can't move past it, but keep working on it.
    It may take years but you WILL get to a point where it will just be something that happened to you but not be the thing that defines who you are as a person.
    You've got so much life ahead of you, also that video of you playing Mortal Kombat was goddamn awesome. Stay strong!
