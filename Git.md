# Git

Git works by augmenting regular directories into Git repositories.
Only file deltas are stored from commit to commit, so the storage is minimal.

* Repository = Working folder that includes additional files used by Git to index/keep track of files and changes
* Refs = Branches and tags (`.\.git\refs\`)

## Configuration

### Configuration Scopes

Several scopes of configuration are defined:

* `--system` = System
* `--global` = User
* _none_ = current Repository

And their corresponding file location:

* System = `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\etc\gitconfig`
  * attr = `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\etc\gitattributes`
* User/Global = `~\.gitconfig`
* Repository = `.\.git\config`

### CLI

On Windows, Command-line parameters must use double " instead of single ' quotes.

* `git config`
* `git config --{modifier} {section}.{parameter} {value}`
* `git config --edit` = opens the (targeted) configuration file
* `git config --edit --system`
* `git config --global user.email "a@b.c"`
* `git config --global user.name "Koko"`
* `git config core.safecrlf warn` = make Linux-Windows line endings non-blocking
* `git config --global alias.co checkout` = alias

### Config Sections

* [alias](https://githowto.com/aliases)
  * `{abbr} = {long_command_with_parameters}`
  * `hist = log --pretty=format:"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]" --graph --date=short`
* [user]
  * email
  * name
* [credential]
  * `helper = manager` = remove this to prevent GIT Credential Manager (see <https://stackoverflow.com/a/37185202/3559724>)
* [core]
  * `askpass =` = disables the OpenSSH credentials popup too

#### Configuration Files

* .gitconfig = configuration sections
* .gitattributes = (binary/textual) merging strategy per file type
* .gitignore = tracking strategy per file type

### Windows Git Credential Manager

Stores logins in Windows Credential Store.

Uninstall Git Credential Manager = `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\libexec\git-core\git-credential-manager.exe uninstall`

See [here]<https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows>.

## API

### Init

Sets up the current directory as a GIT repository

    git init

### Add

Adds (aka Stages) all or specific files to be included in the next commit.
This enables modularity on what will get commited or not in the next commit transaction.
See <https://githowto.com/staging_and_committing>

    git add {FILE}
    git add . # All the files in the current directory and its subdirectories
    git add '*.txt' # All the files in the current directory and its subdirectories matching the pattern
    git add -i # Add interactively

### Reset

Opposite of Add; Unregister one or all files staged for commit

    git reset \[FILE\]
    git reset --soft HEAD~1 # Cancels the last commit

### Commit

The Commit itself. All staged files are commited ("snapshot") to the repository
A Commit message is expected.
If it is not provided in the command line, the default text editor is launched and its result fed as message

    git commit
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    git commit -a # Also commit add first

### Revert

Opposit of commit; cancel a Commit transaction

    git revert HEAD # Reverts very last commit
    git revert HASH # Reverts specific commit

### Status

Status of the repository (OK, staged files, modifications not yet staged, etc.)

    git status

### Branch

Lists all branches

    git branch

Name a commit branch

    git branch NAME HASH

### Tag

    git tag TAG # Gives a name to currently checked-out Commit from which it'll be referrable
    git tag # Lists existing tags

### Log

Lists commits in anti-chronological order

    git log # Lists commits up to currently checked-out
    git log BRANCH # Lists commits up to provided commit
    git log TAG # Lists commits up to provided commit

#### Options (see 'man git-log' or 'git log --help')

    --pretty=oneline # Compact view
    --pretty=format:'' # %(ad = Author Date | an = Author | cd = Date | d = Branch | h = Hash | s = Comment)
                       # Using %d format, indicates where HEAD points, branchs names & Commit tags
    --max-count=10 # Limit
    --since="5 minutes ago" # After
    --until="5 minutes ago" # Before
    --date=short # Date format
    --author="Name"
    --graph # Draw Ascii tree of commits 
    --all # Includes all Commits, not just the ancestors of currently checked-out

#### Visual GUI log visualizer

    gitk

### Checkout

Replaces files in the working directory with repository Branch/Commit version
The currently checked out version is indicated by HEAD in the logs

Checks-out all files of specific Commit and switches to detached HEAD state

    git checkout HASH
    git checkout TAG
    git checkout TAG^ # Commit before the one given by its tag (aka TAG^1). On windows, use ~ instead of ^
    git checkout TAG^n # N-th Commit before the one given by its tag

Checks-out the latest version of a branch

    git checkout . # Current branch (see <https://stackoverflow.com/a/14075772>)
    git checkout BRANCH # E.g. default branch 'git checkout master'
    git checkout BRANCH^ # Second to last commit in the branch
    git checkout BRANCH^ # N-th to last commit in the branch
    git checkout -b BRANCH # Creates a branch and points to it

Reverts specific file to currently checked-out Commit version
A file that's been modified must be commited or reverted before we can checkout a version where it was different

    git checkout FILE

### Remote

Add a link to remote repository from local repository

    git remote add REMOTE_NAME REMOTE_URL # (REMOTE_NAME e.g. 'origin' or 'upstream')
    git remote remove NAME
    git remote set-url REMOTE_NAME git@github.com:username/repo.git
    git remote -v # Display dfined remotes of current repo
    git remote prune origin # Clean remote branches

### Clone

Downloads entire remote repository into current directory (creates a local repository including all branches).
Set URL as default 'origin' remote. If 'origin' is a forking repo, add an 'upstream' remote to keep track of forked original.

    git clone REMOTE_URL

### Push

Upload local repository onto remote existing repository

    git push REMOTE_NAME BRANCH

### Pull

Pull is a combination of fetch and merge

    git pull NAME BRANCH

### Fetch/Merge

    git fetch # Downloads/updates from remote repository into local repository
    git merge FETCH_HEAD # Joins development histories

## Github

Fork # Copy of an existing project to own user account
Pull Request # A request for integrating the changes of a forking repo into the forked original

### How to upload a local repo to GitHub

1. Create the repo on GitHub using the website interface (or API)
2. Add a remote using the URL provided by GitHub on creation (e.g. 'git remote add origin <https://github.com/User/repo.git>')
3. Push the local repo onto the remote repo (e.g. 'git push origin master')

### README

It's good practice to include a README file in each repository, whose content will be displayed on the repo page
Such a file can have different file extensions; only one is chosen by priority (README.md > README > README.txt)
README.md uses Markdown syntax language (text format editing Ã  la wiki)

## Troubleshooting

* Temporarily disable SSL certificates: `git config http.sslVerify false`
